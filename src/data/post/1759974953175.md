## 🔹 Introduction

Have you ever wanted to build your own version of ChatGPT — a chatbot that understands instructions, retrieves data, and interacts intelligently — but thought it required deep coding skills?

Good news: it doesn’t have to be that hard anymore.

**[Flowise](https://docs.flowiseai.com/)** is an *open-source* platform that lets anyone build **AI Agents and LLM workflows** visually, using an intuitive **drag-and-drop interface**.

In this article, you’ll learn:

* What Flowise is and why it’s so useful
* The three main visual builders inside Flowise
* The key capabilities that make it powerful
* How to contribute or get help from the community

Let’s dive in!

## 🧠 What Is Flowise?

Flowise is an **open-source generative AI development platform** designed to make building **AI Agents and Large Language Model (LLM) workflows** simple and visual — no deep programming required.

It offers a complete toolkit that includes:

✅ **Visual Builder** – create workflows easily with drag-and-drop
✅ **Tracing & Analytics** – monitor your AI’s performance
✅ **Evaluations** – test and improve your models
✅ **Human in the Loop** – let humans validate or edit AI outputs
✅ **API, CLI, SDK, Embedded Chatbot** – integrate AI anywhere
✅ **Teams & Workspaces** – collaborate with others

In short, Flowise bridges the gap between *AI ideas* and *real-world implementation*.

## 🧩 The 3 Visual Builders in Flowise

Flowise offers **three main builders** — each tailored for different skill levels and project types.

### 1. 🗣️ Assistant — The Easiest Option for Beginners

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2F9el6yIQeSENvCV5tU3rW%2FScreenshot%202025-06-10%20232758.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e14343d0-6128-45ed-a9d9-e0c934c63344"><img src="https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2Fo43CuYoNE9AEaYJP1yme%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=54c63256-7b14-4861-8ab4-824f774d0b8d" alt="Flowise Assistant Interface"></picture></figure>

The **Assistant** builder is perfect for first-time users.
It lets you create a **chat assistant** that can follow instructions, use tools when needed, and even **retrieve information from uploaded documents** using [RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation).

🧩 Example: You could build a study assistant that answers questions from your PDF lecture notes — right inside a chat!

### 2. 💬 Chatflow — For Building Flexible Chatbots and LLM Flows

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2FhzSnmLUOcCBAlpolUcZZ%2Fscreely-1749594035877.png?alt=media&#x26;token=7659c389-7037-497e-b8e9-f5dc72221cae"><img src="https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2FF9wMU4Dx7pwV8BiwaYPl%2Fscreely-1749593961545.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9138d14e-cbc0-46de-a30a-1b7ef9eaa157" alt="Flowise Chatflow Interface"></picture></figure>

**Chatflow** is designed for **single-agent systems** and simple chatbot workflows.
It’s more flexible than Assistant and supports advanced AI techniques such as:

* **Graph RAG** – better context retrieval
* **Retriever & Reranker** – more accurate search results
* **Custom logic** – for structured or branching conversations

If you want your chatbot to behave more intelligently or handle multi-step reasoning, Chatflow is your go-to.

### 3. 🤖 Agentflow — Advanced Mode for Multi-Agent Systems

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2FZxGswbXpJ3wcJyNHRVSg%2Fscreely-1749594631028.png?alt=media&#x26;token=490115f1-562f-4300-81a7-4e3cefa52ec2"><img src="https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2Fc4EwQgQRnRYD9lbblfpE%2Fscreely-1749594614881.png?alt=media&#x26;token=cd4f1a8f-e7d7-4552-afe4-eb583f5fc199" alt="Flowise Agentflow Interface"></picture></figure>

**Agentflow** is the most powerful of the three — a *superset* of both Assistant and Chatflow.
It allows you to build **multi-agent systems** and **complex AI workflows** that can collaborate, delegate, and execute multiple processes at once.

You can even orchestrate full workflows like automated report generation, data analysis, or digital assistants that manage tasks across apps.

Learn more about it in the official [Agentflow V2 documentation](https://docs.flowiseai.com/using-flowise/agentflowv2).
