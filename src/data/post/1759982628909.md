How to Embed the Flowise Chatbot on Your Website — A Friendly Step-by-Step Guide

---

**Introduction**

Have you ever wished your website could answer visitors’ questions instantly, guide them through your services, or provide help 24/7 without needing a team of staff? Good news: adding an AI-powered chat widget is easier than you think! In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to embed the [Flowise Chatbot](https://flowiseai.com) into your website — even if you’re not a tech wizard. By the end, you’ll know how to set it up, customize its look, and troubleshoot common issues.

**Section 1: Adding the Chat Widget — The Easy Copy-Paste Method**

Embedding Flowise is as simple as copying a code snippet, just like pasting a sticker on your site. 

**Here’s how:**

1. Find the provided widget script.
2. Paste it anywhere between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags of your HTML file.

**Example:**  
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/FlowiseAI/FlowiseChatEmbed@main/dist/web.js"></script>
<script>
  Chatbot.init({
    chatflowid: "your-chatflowid-here",
    apiHost: "your-apihost-here",
  });
</script>
```
*Replace `your-chatflowid-here` and `your-apihost-here` with your bot's actual IDs.*

**Section 2: Choosing the Right Widget Version**

Just as apps have versions, Flowise Chatbot’s widget script does too!

- **Latest Features:** Use a newer version for the freshest features.
- **Older Compatibility:** If your Flowise server is older, you might need [flowise-embed v1.3.14](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flowise-embed?activeTab=versions).

**Example:**  
```html
<script type="module">
  import Chatbot from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowise-embed@1.3.14/dist/web.js';
  Chatbot.init({
    chatflowid: 'your-chatflowid-here',
    apiHost: 'your-apihost-here',
  })
</script>
```
_Check your Flowise version before you choose!_

**Section 3: Customizing Your Chatbot — Make It Your Own**

Imagine decorating your chatbot like you’d design a shop window. You can tweak colors, messages, tooltips, and more!

**What you can customize:**  
- **Button:** Position, size, color, icon  
- **Tooltip:** Message and style  
- **Disclaimer:** Legal notice with text and design  
- **Chat Window:** Title, welcome messages, avatars, background  
- **Custom CSS:** Advanced users can style almost anything

**Example Theme Setup:**  
```html
<script>
  Chatbot.init({
    chatflowid: "your-chatflowid-here",
    apiHost: "your-apihost-here",
    theme: {
      button: { backgroundColor: '#3B81F6', size: 48 },
      chatWindow: { title: 'Flowise Bot', welcomeMessage: 'Welcome!' }
      // ...lots more options!
    }
  });
</script>
```
See the [full configuration list](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/FlowiseChatEmbed#configuration) for every option.

**Section 4: Advanced Options — Custom Code and Observations**

Feeling adventurous? You can:

- **Modify the widget’s source code** (fork on GitHub, edit, and use your own custom build).
- **Monitor the chatbot’s activity** (like logging user input or bot messages with observer functions).

**Section 5: Troubleshooting — Fixing CORS Issues**

Sometimes, browsers block your widget for security. If you see errors about “CORS policy,” don’t panic!  
You simply need to allow Cross-Origin Requests so your chatbot can work.

**How to Fix:**  
- Set environment variables on your server:
  ```
  CORS_ORIGINS=*
  IFRAME_ORIGINS=*
  ```
- If hosting with Docker or a local setup, add the lines to your `.env` file.
