Understanding Variables in Flowise: A Simple Guide for Beginners

---

**Introduction:**  
If you’re just getting started with Flowise and wondering how variables work, you’re in the right place! Variables are like little reusable boxes that hold information you might need in your workflow. Learning to use variables in Flowise can help you make your projects smarter and more flexible, whether you want to store fixed values or fetch dynamic data. In this article, you’ll discover the basics of Flowise variables, their different types, and practical ways to use them, all explained in plain, beginner-friendly language.

## What Are Variables, and Why Do They Matter?

Think of variables as labeled containers that store values for you. Imagine you have a recipe, and instead of writing “2 cups of flour” each time, you just say “amountOfFlour.” Whenever you need to update your recipe, you only have to change the value in one place—the variable. In Flowise, variables help you organize your data and make your flows easier to manage.

**Why use variables?**
- Make your workflows more adaptable
- Avoid repeating the same values everywhere
- Easily update data in one spot

## Static vs. Runtime Variables

### Static Variables  
Static variables are simple values you set once and use throughout your workflow. Whatever value you assign stays the same until you manually change it.

**Example:**  
Suppose you always want your chatbot to greet users as “friend.” You set a static variable called `userGreeting` to “friend,” and every time your bot runs, it uses that word.

**Visual Reference:**

### Runtime Variables  
Runtime variables are dynamic—they pull their value from the `.env` file using something called `process.env`. This means the value can change depending on your environment or settings.

**Example:**  
If you want your bot to fetch an API key secretly, you can store it in your `.env` file. Whenever Flowise needs the key, it grabs the current value from that file.

**Visual Reference:**

## Overriding Variables through the API

Sometimes, you might want to temporarily change a variable for a specific situation. Flowise lets you override a variable’s value via the API, but you first need to allow this in your settings.

**How to enable variable override:**
- Go to **Settings** > **Configuration** > **Security** tab  
![Enable variable override](https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-84a0ce966ccbe453f66baf2d066b45f95421d51d%2Fimage%20(1)%20(1).png?alt=media)

Once enabled, you can send a JSON like this through the API to set a new value:

```json
{
    "question": "hello",
    "overrideConfig": {
        "vars": {
            "var": "some-override-value"
        }
    }
}
```

If the variable already exists, it will use your new value for that session.

## How to Use Variables in Flowise Nodes

Variables are awesome because you can use them almost anywhere in Flowise. For example, you might create a variable called `character`:

**Visual Reference:**  
![Create variable in Flowise](https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-431b030ebef512dbe8017f99afef7309da17545a%2Fimage%20(96).png?alt=media)

Then you can pull its value into different nodes using:
- `$vars.character`
- Or in text formats: `{{$vars.character}}`

**Where can you use variables?**
- [Custom Tool](https://docs.flowiseai.com/integrations/langchain/tools/custom-tool)
- [Custom Function](https://docs.flowiseai.com/integrations/utilities/custom-js-function)
- [Custom Loader](https://docs.flowiseai.com/integrations/langchain/document-loaders/custom-document-loader)
- [If Else](https://docs.flowiseai.com/integrations/utilities/if-else)
- Custom MCP

**Visual Usage Example:**  
![Node variable usage](https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-f39017ccf54d011dc38818c46158aa6e5ce71fef%2Fimage%20(105).png?alt=media)

And in text input for any node, use:

`{{$vars.<variable-name>}}`

Here’s an example within an Agent System Message:

Prompt Templates work similarly:

## Conclusion: Key Takeaways

- **Variables in Flowise** can be static (fixed values) or runtime (dynamic, environment-based values).
- You can override variables via the API if you enable the feature.
- Variables make your flow more powerful and flexible—just use `$vars.<variable-name>` or `{{$vars.<variable-name>}}` wherever you need them.
- They work in many nodes including custom tools, functions, prompts, and more.

By understanding and using variables, you’ll unlock a whole new level of customization and efficiency in your Flowise workflows.

## FAQ

**Q1: What if I forget to enable variable override?**  
A: The API won’t be able to change your variable’s value unless you enable it in Settings > Configuration > Security tab.

**Q2: Can I use variables in any node?**  
A: Most nodes support variables, especially those that accept custom input or logic. Just follow the format shown above.

**Q3: What’s the difference between static and runtime variables?**  
A: Static variables keep the same value you set, while runtime variables fetch their value from your environment (e.g., from the `.env` file), allowing for dynamic updates.

**Call to Action:**  
Ready to practice? Try creating both a static and runtime variable in your Flowise project. See how they work in different nodes, and experiment with overriding a value via the API. If you have questions or a cool variable trick, share your experience in the comments below!
