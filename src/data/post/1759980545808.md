## Level Up Your GitHub Actions Game

You've learned the basics of GitHub Actions‚Äîhow to create workflows, trigger them, and pass data around. Now it's time to level up and learn the advanced features that will make your workflows faster, more efficient, and more powerful.

Think of this as moving from being able to drive a car to understanding how the engine works and how to tune it for maximum performance.

**In this guide, you'll discover:**

- The different types of runners and when to use each
- How to run the same tests across multiple versions (matrix builds)
- Speed optimization techniques (caching, parallelization)
- How to make your workflows more maintainable and reusable
- Best practices from real-world production usage

Let's dive in!

## Understanding Runner Types: Where Your Code Actually Runs

Remember that `runs-on` line in your workflows? That's where you specify which computer (runner) will execute your code. Let's explore your options:

### 1. GitHub-Hosted Runners (The Easy Button)

These are virtual machines that GitHub provides and maintains for you.

**Available options:**

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-24.04      # Linux (most common)
runs-on: ubuntu-22.04      # Older Linux version
runs-on: windows-latest    # Windows
runs-on: macos-latest      # macOS (for iOS development)
runs-on: macos-13          # Intel-based macOS
```

**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ Zero setup required
- ‚úÖ GitHub maintains everything
- ‚úÖ Free tier available
- ‚úÖ Fresh environment every run (no leftover files)

**Cons:**

- ‚ùå Limited performance (2-core CPU, 7GB RAM)
- ‚ùå Slower than self-hosted alternatives
- ‚ùå Costs add up for private repos
- ‚ùå Can't customize the base image much

**Best for:** Small projects, open source, getting started

_[Source: Complete GitHub Actions Course - 45:10-45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwpi0ITkL3U&t=2710s)_

### 2. Third-Party Hosted Runners (Speed & Cost Optimization)

Companies like **Namespace** (the course sponsor) provide faster runners at lower costs.

**Example configuration:**

```yaml
runs-on: namespace-profile-default-x64-4x8 # 4 CPU, 8GB RAM
```

**Why use third-party runners?**

**Speed improvements:**

- üöÄ Faster CPUs (up to 64 cores available)
- üöÄ More RAM (up to 256GB)
- üöÄ Faster storage (NVMe SSDs)
- üöÄ Better network speeds

**Cost savings:**

- üí∞ Can be 40-60% cheaper than GitHub-hosted
- üí∞ More bang for your buck (faster = less billable time)

**Additional features:**

- üìä Better observability and analytics
- ‚ö° Faster caching systems
- üê≥ Optimized Docker builds

**Best for:** Teams with heavy builds, companies optimizing CI costs, performance-critical workflows

_[Source: Complete GitHub Actions Course - 45:27-46:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwpi0ITkL3U&t=2727s)_

### 3. Self-Hosted Runners (Full Control)

Run the GitHub Actions runner software on your own infrastructure.

**Setup example:**

```yaml
runs-on: self-hosted
# Or with labels:
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64, gpu]
```

**Why self-host?**

**Full control:**

- ‚öôÔ∏è Install any dependencies you need
- ‚öôÔ∏è Use specialized hardware (GPUs, ARM processors)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Access private networks or databases
- ‚öôÔ∏è Pre-load large dependencies (no download time)

**Cost optimization:**

- üí∞ Use existing servers you're already paying for
- üí∞ On-demand EC2 instances (with tools like runs-on)
- üí∞ No per-minute billing

**Security:**

- üîí Keep sensitive data in your VPC
- üîí Don't send code to third-party servers

**Challenges:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è You maintain the infrastructure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to handle security updates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Must clean up between runs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex setup

**Best for:** Large enterprises, specialized hardware needs, strict security requirements, high-volume usage

### Comparison Table

| Feature                  | GitHub-Hosted | Third-Party | Self-Hosted  |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| **Setup effort**         | None          | Minimal     | High         |
| **Performance**          | Standard      | High        | Variable     |
| **Cost (private repos)** | Medium        | Low-Medium  | Very Low     |
| **Maintenance**          | GitHub        | Provider    | You          |
| **Customization**        | Limited       | Medium      | Full         |
| **Security**             | Good          | Good        | Full control |

## Matrix Builds: Test Everywhere at Once

Imagine you need to test your app on:

- Node.js versions 16, 18, and 20
- On Linux, Windows, and macOS
- That's 3 √ó 3 = **9 different combinations!**

Writing 9 separate jobs would be a nightmare. Enter: **matrix builds**.

### Basic Matrix Strategy

```yaml
name: Matrix Build Example

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        node-version: [16, 18, 20]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

**What happens here?**

GitHub automatically creates **9 separate jobs** (3 OS √ó 3 Node versions) and runs them in parallel!

**Job names generated:**

- `test (ubuntu-latest, 16)`
- `test (ubuntu-latest, 18)`
- `test (ubuntu-latest, 20)`
- `test (windows-latest, 16)`
- ... and so on

### Advanced Matrix: Include & Exclude

Sometimes you need more control:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    node-version: [16, 18, 20]

    # Add an extra combination
    include:
      - os: macos-latest
        node-version: 20
        special-flag: true

    # Skip a specific combination
    exclude:
      - os: windows-latest
        node-version: 16
```

**This creates:**

- ‚úÖ All Ubuntu combinations (3 jobs)
- ‚úÖ Windows with Node 18 and 20 (2 jobs)
- ‚úÖ macOS with Node 20 only (1 job)
- ‚ùå Skips Windows with Node 16

**Why use this?**

- Some combinations might not make sense
- Save build minutes by skipping redundant tests
- Add platform-specific configurations

### Matrix with Dynamic Values

You can even compute matrix values:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node-version: ${{ fromJSON(vars.NODE_VERSIONS) }}
    # Where NODE_VERSIONS is a repo variable: ["16", "18", "20"]
```

**Benefits:** Update versions in one place (the variable) instead of editing YAML files.

_[Matrix builds documentation is implied from the course structure but not explicitly timestamped in the provided transcript]_

## Caching: Don't Download the Internet Every Time

Every time your workflow runs, it starts with a fresh virtual machine. This means:

- üì¶ No npm packages installed
- üì¶ No Python libraries
- üì¶ No previously compiled code

**The problem:** Downloading dependencies can take 2-5 minutes (or more!) on every run.

**The solution:** Caching!

### Basic Dependency Caching

**For Node.js/npm:**

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - name: Cache node modules
    uses: actions/cache@v3
    with:
      path: ~/.npm
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
      restore-keys: |
        ${{ runner.os }}-node-

  - run: npm install
  - run: npm test
```

**How it works:**

1. **First run:** Downloads all packages, saves to cache
2. **Second run:** Restores from cache (10-30 seconds vs 2-5 minutes!)
3. **Cache invalidated:** When `package-lock.json` changes (new dependencies)

**For Python/pip:**

```yaml
- name: Cache pip packages
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
```

**For Go modules:**

```yaml
- name: Cache Go modules
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/go/pkg/mod
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-go-
```

### Caching Build Artifacts

You can also cache compiled code:

```yaml
- name: Cache build output
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ./dist
    key: build-${{ github.sha }}
```

**Use case:** Build once in a "build" job, then reuse in "test" and "deploy" jobs.

### Cache Best Practices

**‚úÖ DO:**

- Cache dependencies (node_modules, pip packages, etc.)
- Use specific cache keys based on lock files
- Provide fallback keys with `restore-keys`
- Cache build outputs to share between jobs

**‚ùå DON'T:**

- Cache things that change every run
- Use vague cache keys like `my-cache`
- Forget to update cache when dependencies change
- Cache secrets or sensitive data

**Performance impact:** Caching can reduce workflow time by 40-70%!

_[Caching concepts are fundamental to CI/CD optimization but specific timestamps not provided in transcript]_

## Reusable Workflows: Don't Repeat Yourself

If you have multiple repositories with similar workflows, you end up copying and pasting YAML everywhere. When you need to update something, you have to change 50 files!

**Reusable workflows** solve this problem.

### Creating a Reusable Workflow

**File: `.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml`**

```yaml
name: Reusable Test Workflow

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      node-version:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      NPM_TOKEN:
        required: true

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}

      - run: npm install
        env:
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}

      - run: npm test
```

**Key parts:**

- `on: workflow_call:` - Marks this as reusable
- `inputs:` - Parameters other workflows can pass in
- `secrets:` - Secrets must be explicitly passed

### Using the Reusable Workflow

**File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    uses: my-org/shared-workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml@main
    with:
      node-version: '18'
    secrets:
      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

**Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ Define once, use everywhere
- ‚úÖ Update in one place
- ‚úÖ Enforce standards across repos
- ‚úÖ Easier maintenance

**Real-world use case:** A company with 50 microservices can define a standard CI workflow once and reuse it across all repos.

## Composite Actions: Bundle Steps Together

While reusable workflows let you share entire workflows, **composite actions** let you bundle multiple steps into a single reusable action.

### Creating a Composite Action

**File: `.github/actions/setup-node-app/action.yml`**

```yaml
name: 'Setup Node App'
description: 'Setup Node.js and install dependencies with caching'

inputs:
  node-version:
    description: 'Node.js version to use'
    required: true
    default: '18'

runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}

    - name: Cache dependencies
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.npm
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      shell: bash
      run: npm ci
```

### Using Your Composite Action

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Use your composite action
      - uses: ./.github/actions/setup-node-app
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm test
```

**When to use composite actions:**

- You repeat the same 3-5 steps across multiple workflows
- You want to encapsulate setup logic
- You need to share steps within a single repo (not across repos)

**When to use reusable workflows:**

- You want to share entire jobs or workflows
- You need to share across multiple repositories
- You want to define a complete CI/CD pipeline

## Conditional Execution: Smart Workflows

Sometimes you want steps or jobs to run only under certain conditions.

### Job-Level Conditions

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && success()
    steps:
      - run: ./deploy.sh
```

**This deploy job only runs if:**

- ‚úÖ The test job succeeded
- ‚úÖ We're on the `main` branch

### Step-Level Conditions

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - name: Run tests
    run: npm test

  - name: Notify on failure
    if: failure()
    run: echo "Tests failed!" | mail -s "CI Failure" dev-team@example.com
```

**This notification only runs if:** The previous step failed.

### Common Condition Patterns

**Only on main branch:**

```yaml
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

**Only on pull requests:**

```yaml
if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
```

**Only if previous job succeeded:**

```yaml
if: success()
```

**Only if previous job failed:**

```yaml
if: failure()
```

**Always run (even if previous steps failed):**

```yaml
if: always()
```

**Only on specific file changes:**

```yaml
if: contains(github.event.head_commit.modified, 'src/')
```

**Combine multiple conditions:**

```yaml
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && success() && !cancelled()
```

## Concurrency Control: Prevent Workflow Pile-Ups

Imagine you push 5 commits rapidly. GitHub Actions will start 5 workflow runs simultaneously. But what if you only care about the latest one?

**Concurrency control** to the rescue!

### Cancel In-Progress Runs

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

concurrency:
  group: production-deploy
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: ./deploy.sh
```

**What happens:**

- Push commit A ‚Üí Deploy starts
- Push commit B ‚Üí Deploy A is **cancelled**, Deploy B starts
- Push commit C ‚Üí Deploy B is **cancelled**, Deploy C starts

**Result:** Only the latest deployment runs!

### Per-Branch Concurrency

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: deploy-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

**This creates separate concurrency groups per branch:**

- Commits on `main` ‚Üí Group: `deploy-refs/heads/main`
- Commits on `feature/auth` ‚Üí Group: `deploy-refs/heads/feature/auth`

**Benefit:** Deployments on different branches don't cancel each other.

### Per-PR Concurrency

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ci-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

**Use case:** In a PR with many commits, only test the latest code.

## Container Jobs: Run in Docker Environments

Instead of running directly on the VM, you can run jobs inside Docker containers.

### Why Use Container Jobs?

**Consistency:**

- ‚úÖ Same environment locally and in CI
- ‚úÖ Pin exact versions of all tools
- ‚úÖ Reproducible builds

**Isolation:**

- ‚úÖ Don't pollute the runner
- ‚úÖ Clean state every time

### Basic Container Job

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: node:18-alpine
      options: --user root

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

**Now your steps run inside the `node:18-alpine` container!**

### With Service Containers (Databases, etc.)

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    container: node:18

    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15
        env:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/test
```

**What's happening:**

1. Spin up a PostgreSQL container
2. Wait for it to be healthy
3. Run your tests against it
4. Tear everything down

**Use cases:**

- Integration tests with real databases
- Testing with Redis, RabbitMQ, etc.
- Multi-service testing

## Debugging Workflows: When Things Go Wrong

Debugging GitHub Actions can be frustrating. Here are techniques to make it easier:

### 1. Enable Debug Logging

Set these secrets in your repo:

- `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` = `true`
- `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` = `true`

**Result:** Super verbose logs showing every command executed.

### 2. Print Context Information

```yaml
- name: Dump GitHub context
  run: echo '${{ toJSON(github) }}'

- name: Dump environment
  run: env | sort
```

**See all available data** to understand what's happening.

### 3. Use tmate for SSH Access

```yaml
- name: Setup tmate session
  if: failure()
  uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
```

**When a step fails,** this gives you an SSH connection to the runner so you can poke around!

### 4. Local Testing with `act`

Install `act` and run workflows locally:

```bash
# Install act
brew install act  # macOS
# or download from: https://github.com/nektos/act

# Run a workflow locally
act push

# Run a specific job
act -j test

# List all workflows
act -l
```

**Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ Test changes before pushing
- ‚úÖ Faster feedback loop
- ‚úÖ No wasted GitHub Actions minutes

**Limitations:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not 100% identical to GitHub's environment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some features not supported

## Performance Optimization Checklist

Let's bring it all together. Here's your optimization checklist:

### Speed Optimizations

- ‚úÖ **Use caching** for dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Parallelize jobs** when possible
- ‚úÖ **Use matrix builds** instead of sequential jobs
- ‚úÖ **Cancel outdated runs** with concurrency control
- ‚úÖ **Use faster runners** (third-party or self-hosted)
- ‚úÖ **Cache Docker layers** when building images
- ‚úÖ **Use sparse checkouts** if you don't need the full repo

### Cost Optimizations

- ‚úÖ **Use path filters** to avoid unnecessary runs
- ‚úÖ **Skip redundant jobs** with conditionals
- ‚úÖ **Use self-hosted runners** for high-volume workloads
- ‚úÖ **Optimize build times** (faster = cheaper)
- ‚úÖ **Use matrix includes/excludes** to skip unnecessary combinations

### Maintainability Optimizations

- ‚úÖ **Create reusable workflows** for common patterns
- ‚úÖ **Use composite actions** for repeated steps
- ‚úÖ **Version pin your actions** (use commit SHAs)
- ‚úÖ **Document your workflows** with comments
- ‚úÖ **Use meaningful job and step names**

## Real-World Example: Optimized Node.js CI

Let's put it all together in a production-ready workflow:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
      - 'package*.json'
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

concurrency:
  group: ci-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18, 20]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm'

      - run: npm ci

      - run: npm run lint

      - run: npm test

**What makes this optimized:**

- ‚úÖ Path filters (only runs on relevant changes)
- ‚úÖ Concurrency control (cancels old runs)
- ‚úÖ Matrix testing (tests multiple Node versions)
- ‚úÖ Built-in caching (`cache: 'npm'`)
- ‚úÖ Job dependencies (proper ordering)
- ‚úÖ Conditionals (only deploy from main)
- ‚úÖ Artifact sharing (build once, use in deploy)
- ‚úÖ Environment protection (production environment)

## Key Takeaways

Let's recap the advanced features we've covered:

1. **Choose the right runner** - GitHub-hosted for simplicity, third-party for speed, self-hosted for control

2. **Matrix builds multiply your tests** - Test across multiple versions/platforms without duplicating code

3. **Caching saves massive amounts of time** - Dependencies, build outputs, and more

4. **Reusable workflows eliminate duplication** - Define once, use everywhere

5. **Composite actions bundle common steps** - Great for frequently repeated setups

6. **Conditionals make workflows smart** - Run only what's needed, when it's needed

7. **Concurrency control prevents waste** - Cancel outdated runs automatically

8. **Container jobs ensure consistency** - Same environment everywhere

9. **Debugging doesn't have to be painful** - Use debug logs, tmate, and act

10. **Optimization is multi-dimensional** - Speed, cost, and maintainability all matter

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I use GitHub-hosted or third-party runners?**

A: Start with GitHub-hosted for simplicity. Switch to third-party (like Namespace) when you notice speed issues or high costs. Consider self-hosted for very high volume or special requirements.

**Q: How much faster is caching?**

A: Typically 40-70% faster. A 5-minute workflow might drop to 2-3 minutes with good caching.

**Q: Can I use matrix builds with self-hosted runners?**

A: Yes! You can mix and match. For example, use GitHub-hosted for Linux tests and self-hosted for specialized hardware.

**Q: What's the difference between reusable workflows and composite actions?**

A: Reusable workflows share entire jobs across repos. Composite actions share steps within workflows. Use reusable workflows for complete CI/CD pipelines, composite actions for common setup tasks.

## Practice Challenges
