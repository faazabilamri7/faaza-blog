## Flowise Prediction API Explained: The Easy Way to Connect AI Chatbots to Your App

### Introduction

Ever wondered how apps like chatbots can answer your users’ questions and remember previous conversations? The magic happens through something called an **API**. If you’re working with [Flowise](https://flowiseai.com), one of the most popular open-source tools for AI chatbots and workflows, their **Prediction API** lets you easily interact with your AI flows and assistants.

In this guide, you’ll learn:

- What the Prediction API is and what it can do
- How to send questions and files for AI-based responses
- How to use sample code (Python, JavaScript, or plain HTTP)
- Tips for advanced features like conversation history and file uploads

Let’s break it down together!

---

### What is the Flowise Prediction API?

Think of Flowise’s Prediction API as a direct messaging system between your app and Flowise’s “AI brains” (called flows or assistants). You send a question or data (like text, images, or audio), and the AI responds back—sometimes remembering your earlier messages, or analyzing your uploads.

**Why is this awesome?**
- You can add AI-powered responses to your website, app, or service
- It’s not just chat: you can process images, audio, and trigger smart workflows

More details: [Prediction API Reference](https://docs.flowiseai.com/api-reference/prediction)

### How Does It Work? The Basics

#### The Endpoint You’ll Use

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000` (or wherever your Flowise runs)
- **Main Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/prediction/:id` (replace `:id` with your flow’s ID)
- **Authentication**: Sometimes you need an API key. See [Flow Authorization Guide](https://docs.flowiseai.com/configuration/authorization/chatflow-level)

#### Sending a Simple Message

Here’s the type of data you send (a JSON “body”):

```json
{
    "question": "What's artificial intelligence?",
    "streaming": false
}
```

**Main options:**
- `question`: What the user asks
- `streaming`: If true, you get real-time response chunks (like live typing)
- `uploads`: Images or audio you want analyzed
- `history`: Past messages for context

#### Example: Python Code (using requests)

```python
import requests
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/prediction/your-flow-id",
    json={
        "question": "What's artificial intelligence?",
        "streaming": False
    }
)
print(response.json())
```

#### Example: JavaScript

```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/v1/prediction/your-flow-id', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ question: 'Explain machine learning.', streaming: false })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Key Features, Explained Simply

#### **1. Streaming Responses**
- **What it means:** Instead of waiting for the whole reply, you’ll see words as they come.
- **Why it matters:** Feels faster and more “human.”
- **How:** Just set `"streaming": true` when you send your request.

#### **2. Conversation Memory**
- **What it means:** The AI remembers earlier messages in your chat session.
- **Example:** Greet it, then later ask “What’s my name?” It’ll know!
- **How:** Use the `history` array and/or a `sessionId`.

#### **3. Image & Audio Processing**
- **How:** Send images or audio files inside the `uploads` part of your message.
- **Example:** Identify what's in a photo, or transcribe speech from a recording.
- **Tip:** Use [Image Upload Reference](https://docs.flowiseai.com/uploads#image) and [Audio Upload Reference](https://docs.flowiseai.com/uploads#audio).

#### **4. File Uploads**
- **Purpose:** Upload PDFs, docs, spreadsheets, etc.—the AI can answer questions about them.
- **Reference:** [File Uploads documentation](https://docs.flowiseai.com/uploads#files)

#### **5. Forms and Dynamic Variables**
- **What it is:** If your flow is set up with form fields, send key-values in `"form"`.
- **Variables:** Pass specific variables in `"overrideConfig"`, under `"vars"`.
- **Tip:** See [Variables guide](https://docs.flowiseai.com/using-flowise/variables)

#### **6. Configuration Override**
- You can fine-tune how the flow runs each time (like changing answer style or session).
- **Security Note:** Overrides are disabled by default; enable in settings ([see guide](https://docs.flowiseai.com/api-reference/prediction#configuration-override))

#### **7. Human Feedback**
- If the AI asks for human input—send feedback so it can adjust or resume work.

### A Complete Example: Personalized Workout Plan

Let’s say you want the AI to create a workout plan for a user named Alice.

**Python Example:**

```python
import requests
result = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/prediction/your-flow-id",
    json={
        "question": "Create a personalized workout plan",
        "overrideConfig": {
            "vars": {
                "user_name": "Alice",
                "fitness_level": "intermediate",
                "preferred_duration": "30 minutes"
            }
        }
    }
)
print(result.json())
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **404:** Double-check your flow ID
- **401 Unauthorized:** Check if API key/password is required
- **400 Bad Request:** Make sure you included all needed fields
- **413 Payload Too Large:** Try sending smaller files
- **500 Internal Error:** Check your flow for any mistakes

### Quick Beginner FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know Python or JavaScript to use Prediction API?**  
A: Not required! You can use SDKs in Python or JavaScript, or just send HTTP requests with basic tools like cURL, Postman, or any language you prefer.

**Q: Does the API remember previous messages automatically?**  
A: Yes—if you use the `history` array or set a unique `sessionId`, your conversation context is kept alive.

**Q: Can I upload images, audio, and files for analysis?**  
A: Definitely! Just provide them in the `uploads` part of your API request. See the [uploads guide](https://docs.flowiseai.com/uploads#image) for details.
