## Introduction

Remember learning to ride a bike? The hardest part wasn't understanding how bikes work—it was actually getting on and taking those first few pedals. The same is true for Terraform.

You might understand _what_ Terraform does (if you read our previous article), but the question remains: **How do I actually use it?**

In this comprehensive guide, we're going to go from zero to deploying your first piece of cloud infrastructure using Terraform. We'll install the software, set up authentication with Amazon Web Services (AWS), understand the basic workflow, and actually create a real virtual machine in the cloud.

By the end of this article, you'll have practical, hands-on experience with Terraform—not just theoretical knowledge.

**What you'll learn:**

- How to install Terraform on your computer
- How to authenticate Terraform with AWS
- Understanding Terraform's core architecture (providers and core)
- The four essential Terraform commands
- Creating your first "Hello World" infrastructure
- Understanding Terraform state and backends

Let's dive in!

---

## Understanding Terraform's Architecture: The Big Picture

Before we install anything, let's understand how Terraform actually works under the hood. This will make everything else much clearer.

### Terraform Core: The Brain

At the center of Terraform is something called **Terraform Core**. Think of this as the engine of a car—it's what makes everything run.

Terraform Core does three main things:

1. **Reads your configuration files** - These are the files where you describe what infrastructure you want
2. **Reads the state file** - This tells Terraform what infrastructure currently exists
3. **Figures out what needs to change** - By comparing what you want (config) with what exists (state), it creates a plan

**Simple analogy:**
Imagine you're reorganizing your room.

- **Your mental picture** of the perfect room = Configuration file
- **How your room looks right now** = State file
- **Your plan for what to move** = Terraform Core's job

### Terraform Providers: The Hands

Here's where it gets interesting. Terraform Core is cloud-agnostic—it doesn't know how to talk to AWS, Google Cloud, or any specific service. That's where **providers** come in.

**Providers are like plugins or translators.** Each provider knows how to:

- Talk to a specific service's API (like AWS, Azure, or Cloudflare)
- Translate Terraform's generic commands into specific API calls
- Handle authentication with that service

**How it works together:**

```
Your Config File
    ↓
Terraform Core (reads and plans)
    ↓
Provider Plugin (AWS, for example)
    ↓
AWS API (actually creates resources)
    ↓
Your Infrastructure (servers, databases, etc.)
```

### The Provider Ecosystem

There are **hundreds of providers** available! Some examples:

- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, DigitalOcean
- **DNS & CDN**: Cloudflare, Route53
- **Databases**: MongoDB Atlas, PostgreSQL
- **Monitoring**: Datadog, New Relic
- **Version Control**: GitHub, GitLab
- **And many more!**

Each provider has to be:

1. Specified in your configuration
2. Downloaded during initialization
3. Configured with authentication credentials

Don't worry if this seems abstract—it'll make perfect sense once we actually do it!

## Installing Terraform: Step-by-Step

Now let's get Terraform installed on your computer. The process is slightly different depending on your operating system.

### For macOS Users

The easiest way is using **Homebrew** (a package manager for Mac):

**Step 1:** Open Terminal

**Step 2:** If you don't have Homebrew installed, install it first:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**Step 3:** Install Terraform:

```bash
brew install terraform
```

**Step 4:** Verify installation:

```bash
terraform --version
```

You should see something like `Terraform v1.1.5` (the version number might be different).

### For Windows Users

**Option 1: Using Chocolatey (recommended)**

Chocolatey is like Homebrew but for Windows.

**Step 1:** Open PowerShell as Administrator

**Step 2:** Install Chocolatey (if you don't have it):

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

**Step 3:** Install Terraform:

```powershell
choco install terraform
```

**Option 2: Manual Installation**

1. Go to [terraform.io/downloads](https://terraform.io/downloads)
2. Download the Windows version
3. Unzip the file
4. Move `terraform.exe` to a folder in your PATH (like `C:\Windows\System32`)
5. Verify by opening Command Prompt and typing `terraform --version`

### For Linux Users

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
```

**For other Linux distributions:**
Visit [terraform.io/downloads](https://terraform.io/downloads) for specific instructions.

### Verification

Regardless of your OS, you should now be able to run:

```bash
terraform --version
```

If you see version information, congratulations! Terraform is installed. 🎉

## Setting Up AWS Authentication

Terraform needs permission to create resources in your AWS account. Let's set that up securely.

### Step 1: Create an AWS Account

If you don't have one already:

1. Go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com)
2. Click "Create an AWS Account"
3. Follow the sign-up process (you'll need a credit card, but we'll use free-tier resources)

### Step 2: Create an IAM User for Terraform

**Never use your root AWS account credentials with Terraform!** Instead, create a dedicated user with specific permissions.

**In the AWS Console:**

1. Search for and open **IAM** (Identity and Access Management)
2. Click **Users** in the left sidebar
3. Click **Add users**
4. Enter a username (e.g., `terraform-user`)
5. Select **Access key - Programmatic access**
6. Click **Next: Permissions**

### Step 3: Attach Permissions

For learning purposes, you can attach these policies:

- `AmazonEC2FullAccess` - To create virtual machines
- `AmazonS3FullAccess` - To create storage buckets
- `AmazonRDSFullAccess` - To create databases
- `IAMFullAccess` - To manage permissions
- `AmazonRoute53FullAccess` - To manage DNS

**Important Note:** In production, you should follow the **Principle of Least Privilege**—only grant the minimum permissions needed. For learning, broader permissions make things easier.

### Step 4: Create Access Keys

1. After creating the user, click on the username
2. Go to **Security credentials** tab
3. Click **Create access key**
4. Choose **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
5. Click **Create access key**

You'll see:

- **Access Key ID** - Like a username (e.g., `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`)
- **Secret Access Key** - Like a password (e.g., `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`)

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Save these somewhere safe! You can't see the secret key again after this screen.

### Step 5: Install AWS CLI

Terraform can use AWS CLI credentials for authentication.

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install awscli
```

**Windows:**
Download the installer from [aws.amazon.com/cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

**Linux:**

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

### Step 6: Configure AWS CLI

Run this command:

```bash
aws configure
```

It will prompt you for:

```
AWS Access Key ID: [paste your access key]
AWS Secret Access Key: [paste your secret key]
Default region name: us-east-1
Default output format: json
```

**Understanding regions:**

- `us-east-1` = North Virginia (most common default)
- `us-west-2` = Oregon
- `eu-west-1` = Ireland
- Choose one close to you or stick with `us-east-1`

This creates a file at `~/.aws/credentials` (macOS/Linux) or `C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials` (Windows) that stores your credentials.

## Your First Terraform Configuration: Hello World

Now for the exciting part—let's create some infrastructure!

### Understanding the Configuration File

Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir terraform-hello-world
cd terraform-hello-world
```

Create a file called `main.tf` (Terraform files end in `.tf`):

```hcl
# Configure the AWS Provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Create an EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "HelloWorldInstance"
  }
}
```

Let's break this down:

### Block 1: The Terraform Block

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}
```

This tells Terraform:

- We need the AWS provider
- Get it from HashiCorp's official registry
- Use version 3.0 or higher (but stay in the 3.x range)

**Why pin versions?** To prevent unexpected changes. If version 4.0 comes out with breaking changes, we won't automatically upgrade.

### Block 2: The Provider Configuration

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

This configures the AWS provider:

- Use the `us-east-1` region
- Authentication comes from AWS CLI credentials (we set those up earlier)

### Block 3: The Resource

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "HelloWorldInstance"
  }
}
```

This is where we define actual infrastructure!

**Breaking it down:**

- `resource` = keyword indicating we're creating something
- `"aws_instance"` = type of resource (an EC2 virtual machine)
- `"example"` = our local name for this resource
- `ami` = Amazon Machine Image (the operating system - this one is Ubuntu 20.04)
- `instance_type` = size of the VM (`t2.micro` is free-tier eligible)
- `tags` = metadata to help identify the resource in AWS console

---

## The Four Essential Terraform Commands

Now that we have a configuration, let's use Terraform! There are four commands you'll use constantly:

### 1. terraform init - Initialize the Project

**What it does:**

- Downloads the providers specified in your config
- Sets up the backend (where state is stored)
- Prepares your working directory

**Run it:**

```bash
terraform init
```

**You'll see output like:**

```
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding hashicorp/aws versions matching "~> 3.0"...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v3.76.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v3.76.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

**What happened behind the scenes:**

Your directory now looks like this:

```
terraform-hello-world/
├── main.tf
├── .terraform/              (new!)
│   └── providers/
│       └── hashicorp/
│           └── aws/
│               └── [provider binary]
└── .terraform.lock.hcl      (new!)
```

The `.terraform` directory contains the AWS provider plugin, and the lock file ensures everyone on your team uses the same provider versions.

**When to run it:**

- First time in a new project
- After adding new providers
- After cloning a repo with Terraform code

### 2. terraform plan - Preview Changes

**What it does:**

- Compares your config to current state
- Shows what will be created, modified, or destroyed
- **Doesn't actually make any changes!**

**Run it:**

```bash
terraform plan
```

**You'll see output like:**

```
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.example will be created
  + resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      + ami                          = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
      + instance_type                = "t2.micro"
      + id                           = (known after apply)
      + public_ip                    = (known after apply)
      + tags                         = {
          + "Name" = "HelloWorldInstance"
        }
      # ... many more attributes
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

**Understanding the symbols:**

- `+` means "will be created"
- `~` means "will be modified"
- `-` means "will be destroyed"
- `(known after apply)` means Terraform doesn't know this value yet—AWS will assign it when creating the resource

**When to run it:**

- Before every apply (to preview changes)
- To verify your config does what you expect
- During code reviews to show what will happen

### 3. terraform apply - Make It Happen

**What it does:**

- Runs a plan
- Asks for confirmation
- Executes the plan (creates/modifies/destroys resources)
- Updates the state file

**Run it:**

```bash
terraform apply
```

**You'll see the plan, then:**

```
Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value:
```

**Type `yes` and press Enter.**

Terraform will now create your EC2 instance! This takes a few minutes.

**Output when done:**

```
aws_instance.example: Creating...
aws_instance.example: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
aws_instance.example: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
aws_instance.example: Creation complete after 25s [id=i-0abcd1234efgh5678]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

**Verify in AWS Console:**

1. Log into AWS
2. Go to EC2
3. Make sure you're in the correct region (us-east-1)
4. You should see your instance!

### 4. terraform destroy - Clean Up

**What it does:**

- Destroys all resources managed by this Terraform configuration
- Asks for confirmation
- Updates state file to reflect deletions

**⚠️ WARNING:** This deletes real infrastructure! Only use when you're sure.

**Run it:**

```bash
terraform destroy
```

**You'll see a plan showing what will be destroyed, then:**

```
Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value:
```

**Type `yes` to proceed.**

**Output:**

```
aws_instance.example: Destroying... [id=i-0abcd1234efgh5678]
aws_instance.example: Still destroying... [10s elapsed]
aws_instance.example: Destruction complete after 15s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
```

**When to use it:**

- Cleaning up after learning/testing
- Tearing down temporary environments
- Removing old infrastructure

---

## Understanding Terraform State: The Memory of Your Infrastructure

After running `terraform apply`, you'll notice a new file: `terraform.tfstate`

### What is the State File?

The state file is Terraform's **database of what it has created**. It's a JSON file containing:

- Every resource Terraform manages
- All attributes of those resources
- Metadata and dependencies

**Example snippet from our state file:**

```json
{
  "version": 4,
  "terraform_version": "1.1.5",
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "aws_instance",
      "name": "example",
      "provider": "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws\"]",
      "instances": [
        {
          "attributes": {
            "ami": "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0",
            "id": "i-0abcd1234efgh5678",
            "instance_type": "t2.micro",
            "public_ip": "54.123.45.67",
            ...
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Why Does State Matter?

**1. Tracking Infrastructure**

Without state, Terraform wouldn't know what it created. Each time you run `apply`, it would try to create everything again!

**2. Performance**

Instead of querying AWS for every resource every time, Terraform uses the state file as a cache.

**3. Detecting Changes**

The state file lets Terraform detect "drift"—when someone manually changes infrastructure outside of Terraform.

### Important State File Rules

❌ **Never edit the state file manually** - It's managed by Terraform

❌ **Don't commit state files to Git** - They contain sensitive info (passwords, IPs, etc.)

✅ **Do back up your state file** - Losing it means losing track of your infrastructure

✅ **Do use remote state for teams** - More on this next!

---

## Local vs. Remote State: Where to Store Your State File

### Local State (What We Just Did)

**How it works:**
State file lives in your project directory (`terraform.tfstate`)

**Pros:**

- Simple to get started
- No additional setup needed
- Great for learning

**Cons:**

- ❌ Contains sensitive data in plain text on your computer
- ❌ Hard to collaborate (everyone needs the same state file)
- ❌ No locking (two people could apply changes at once, causing corruption)
- ❌ No automation possible (CI/CD needs access to the file)

### Remote State (Production-Ready)

**How it works:**
State file is stored in a remote location like:

- AWS S3
- Terraform Cloud
- Azure Storage
- Google Cloud Storage

**Pros:**

- ✅ State is encrypted
- ✅ Team members share the same state
- ✅ Locking prevents concurrent modifications
- ✅ CI/CD systems can access it
- ✅ Automatic backups

**Cons:**

- Slightly more complex setup

### Option 1: Terraform Cloud (Easiest Remote State)

**Setup:**

1. Go to [app.terraform.io](https://app.terraform.io) and create an account
2. Create an organization and workspace
3. Update your `main.tf`:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    organization = "your-org-name"

    workspaces {
      name = "your-workspace-name"
    }
  }

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}
```

4. Run `terraform login` to authenticate
5. Run `terraform init` to migrate state

**Pricing:**

- Free for up to 5 users
- $20/user/month after that

### Option 2: AWS S3 Backend (Self-Managed)

**What you need:**

- An S3 bucket (for storing state)
- A DynamoDB table (for locking)

**The bootstrap problem:**
We want to manage everything with Terraform, but we need S3 and DynamoDB _before_ we can use them as a backend!

**Solution - Two-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Create backend resources with local state**

Create `backend-setup.tf`:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# S3 bucket for state
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket-12345"  # Must be globally unique!

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true  # Safety: don't accidentally delete
  }
}

# Enable versioning (can recover from accidents)
resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state.id

  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}

# Enable encryption
resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state.id

  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm = "AES256"
    }
  }
}

# DynamoDB table for locking
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_locks" {
  name         = "terraform-state-locks"
  billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key     = "LockID"  # MUST be exactly "LockID"

  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S"
  }
}
```

Run:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

**Step 2: Migrate to remote backend**

Now update your `main.tf` to use these resources:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket-12345"
    key            = "hello-world/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Run:

```bash
terraform init
```

Terraform will detect the backend change and ask:

```
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Enter a value: yes
```

Your state is now in S3! 🎉

**How locking works:**

When you run `terraform apply`:

1. Terraform creates a lock in DynamoDB
2. If someone else tries to apply, they get an error: "State locked"
3. When your apply finishes, the lock is released
4. Now someone else can apply

This prevents two people from making conflicting changes!

## Finding and Using AWS Resources

You might be wondering: "How did you know to use `aws_instance`? How do I find other resources?"

### The Terraform Registry

Your go-to resource: [registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io)

**Navigation:**

1. Go to registry.terraform.io
2. Click "Browse Providers"
3. Find "AWS" (it has an "Official" badge)
4. Click on it

You'll see:

- Documentation for every AWS resource
- Example code
- All available arguments (parameters)
- Exported attributes (values you can reference)

### Example: Looking up aws_instance

Search for "aws_instance" in the AWS provider docs.

## Common Beginner Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Forgetting to Run `terraform init`

**Error message:**

```
Error: Could not load plugin
Plugin reinitialization required. Please run "terraform init".
```

**Solution:** Always run `terraform init` first in a new directory or after adding providers.

### Mistake 2: Using the Wrong Region

You create a resource in `us-east-1` but you're looking in the AWS console in `us-west-2`.

**Solution:**

- Always double-check your region in both Terraform config and AWS console
- Add region to resource tags for easy identification

### Mistake 3: Hardcoding Sensitive Values

**Bad:**

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  password = "mypassword123"  # ❌ Never do this!
}
```

**Solution:** Use variables (we'll cover this in the next article) and environment variables.

### Mistake 4: Not Reading the Plan

You run `terraform apply` and just type "yes" without reading.

**Solution:** **ALWAYS** read the plan! One typo could destroy production infrastructure.

### Mistake 5: Committing State Files to Git

**Problem:** State files contain sensitive data and IPs.

**Solution:**
Create a `.gitignore` file:

```
# .gitignore
.terraform/
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup
.terraform.lock.hcl
```

## Practical Exercise: Deploy a Web Server

Let's extend our hello world to create a simple web server!

**Challenge:** Modify your `main.tf` to:

1. Create an EC2 instance
2. Configure it to allow HTTP traffic
3. Run a simple web server

**Solution:**

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Security group to allow HTTP traffic
resource "aws_security_group" "web_server" {
  name        = "web-server-sg"
  description = "Allow HTTP inbound traffic"

  ingress {
    description = "HTTP from anywhere"
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "web-server-security-group"
  }
}

# EC2 instance with web server
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.web_server.id]

  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "Hello from Terraform!" > index.html
              nohup python3 -m http.server 80 &
              EOF

  tags = {
    Name = "TerraformWebServer"
  }
}

# Output the public IP
output "public_ip" {
  value       = aws_instance.web.public_ip
  description = "The public IP address of the web server"
}
```

**What's new here:**

1. **Security Group**: Firewall rules allowing HTTP traffic
2. **user_data**: Script that runs when the instance boots
3. **output**: Displays the IP address after creation

**Deploy it:**

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

**After it's done, you'll see:**

```
Outputs:

public_ip = "54.123.45.67"
```

**Test it:**
Open a browser and go to `http://54.123.45.67`

You should see: "Hello from Terraform!"

**Don't forget to clean up:**

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: Do I need to leave my computer running for Terraform to work?

**A:** No! Once `terraform apply` finishes, the infrastructure exists in AWS (or your cloud provider). You can turn off your computer. Terraform only runs when you execute commands—it doesn't continuously monitor your infrastructure.

### Q2: What happens if I lose my state file?

**A:** This is serious! Without state, Terraform doesn't know what it created. You have a few options:

- **Import existing resources** - Manually tell Terraform about each resource
- **Recreate everything** - Potentially dangerous if you have important data
- **Restore from backup** - This is why remote state with versioning is so important!

**Prevention:** Use remote state with backups from day one.

### Q3: Can I use Terraform with multiple AWS accounts?

**A:** Yes! You can:

- Configure different providers with different credentials
- Use AWS profiles in your AWS CLI configuration
- Pass credentials via environment variables

We'll cover this in future articles.

### Q4: Is Terraform free?

**A:** The Terraform CLI is completely free and open source. HashiCorp offers paid products:

- **Terraform Cloud** - Managed remote state and collaboration (free for up to 5 users)
- **Terraform Enterprise** - Self-hosted version with additional features

For learning and small teams, the free tier is plenty!

### Q5: What if I make a mistake in my configuration?

**A:** This is why `terraform plan` is so important! Always:

1. Run `terraform plan` first
2. Read the entire output
3. Verify it's doing what you expect
4. Only then run `terraform apply`

If you do make a mistake and apply it, you can:

- Fix the config and run `terraform apply` again
- Use `terraform destroy` to clean up and start over

## Take Action: Your Next Steps

Now it's your turn to practice!

### Beginner Challenges

1. **Modify the region** - Change from `us-east-1` to `us-west-2` and redeploy
2. **Add tags** - Add more tags to your resources (Environment, Owner, etc.)
3. **Change instance type** - Try `t2.small` instead of `t2.micro`
4. **Add another instance** - Create a second EC2 instance in the same config

### Intermediate Challenges

1. **Set up remote state** - Use S3 backend instead of local state
2. **Create an S3 bucket** - Look up the `aws_s3_bucket` resource and create one
3. **Make a web server** - Use the example from this article and customize the HTML
4. **Add a database** - Look up `aws_db_instance` and add an RDS database
