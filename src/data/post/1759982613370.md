**Getting Started with Flowise Monitoring: Easy Setup with Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry**

---

### Introduction

Imagine running a factory and not knowing how many products you make, where things might break down, or how efficiently everything works. That's a scary thought! The same thing happens if you run software like [Flowise](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise), a platform for building AI flows, without monitoring. If you don't keep track, you're working blind!

In this beginner-friendly guide, you'll learn how Flowise leverages monitoring tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **OpenTelemetry** to give you clear insights into what’s happening under the hood. Whether you’re a developer or just starting out, this article will help you set up monitoring step by step—with explanations, screenshots, and links to resources.

### Why Is Monitoring Important?

**Monitoring** is like having a dashboard for your car. It lets you:

- **Track performance**: Know how well your application is running.
- **Catch problems early**: Spot bottlenecks or downtime before users complain.
- **Make informed decisions**: Use real data to improve and scale efficiently.

Without monitoring, issues can go unnoticed, leading to poor customer experiences and wasted resources.

---

### Flowise Monitoring Overview

Flowise supports several monitoring tools natively:

- **Prometheus**: Collects metrics and data over time.
- **Grafana**: Turns data into beautiful, easy-to-read charts and dashboards.
- **OpenTelemetry (OTel)**: A flexible framework for collecting, processing, and exporting monitoring data.

Flowise tracks high-level metrics (like API requests and prediction counts). For a full list, see [Flowise Metrics Interface](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/main/packages/server/src/Interface.Metrics.ts#L13).

### Setting Up Prometheus for Flowise

#### What is Prometheus?

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is like a smart sensor that keeps an eye on your software and stores important statistics. It helps you know what's going on, even if you have lots of things to monitor.

#### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Configure Environment Variables in Flowise**

   Add these lines to your `.env` file:

   ```
   ENABLE_METRICS=true
   METRICS_PROVIDER=prometheus
   METRICS_INCLUDE_NODE_METRICS=true
   ```

   This tells Flowise to start sending monitoring statistics ("metrics") for Prometheus to collect.

2. **Install and Run Prometheus**

   - Download Prometheus ([Get Started](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)).
   - Use Flowise’s default configuration file: [prometheus.config.yml](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/main/metrics/prometheus/prometheus.config.yml).
   - Start Prometheus and Flowise; open your browser at `http://localhost:9090`.

   **Tip:** The metric endpoint `/api/v1/metrics` should now be live for Prometheus to fetch data.

3. **Visual Check**

   If you see metrics, you’re on track!

### Visualizing Data with Grafana

#### What is Grafana?

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is like a visual dashboard that turns numbers into graphs. It's way easier to understand trends with a chart than with a bunch of raw numbers!

#### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Install Grafana**

   - Follow the official [Grafana installation guide](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/).
   - Grafana usually exposes port **9091**.

2. **Connect Grafana to Prometheus**

   - In Grafana, click on **Add new connection** and select **Prometheus**.
   - Enter Prometheus’s address (usually `localhost:9090`) and **test the connection**.

3. **Set Up Dashboards**

   - Save your **data source ID**—you’ll need it soon.
   - Create a dashboard by importing template files:
     - [API Metrics Dashboard](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/main/metrics/grafana/grafana.dashboard.app.json.txt)
     - [Server Metrics Dashboard](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/main/metrics/grafana/grafana.dashboard.server.json.txt)

     **Pro Tip:** Replace all instances of `cds4j1ybfuhogb` in the templates with your data source ID.

   ![Dashboard Example](https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-23c9f1aedfb95ced189a228375e7f5b06235a88c%2Fimage%20(186).png?alt=media)

   Now, after performing actions in Flowise, you’ll see the metrics appear in live dashboards.

### Advanced: OpenTelemetry Setup

#### What is OpenTelemetry?

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (often called OTel) is like having a versatile toolbox for collecting all sorts of monitoring data, ready to send it anywhere—such as Datadog or Prometheus.

#### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Set Flowise Variables for OTel**

   ```properties
   ENABLE_METRICS=true
   METRICS_PROVIDER=open_telemetry
   METRICS_INCLUDE_NODE_METRICS=true
   METRICS_OPEN_TELEMETRY_METRIC_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318/v1/metrics
   METRICS_OPEN_TELEMETRY_PROTOCOL=http
   METRICS_OPEN_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=true
   ```

2. **Run the OpenTelemetry Collector**

   - Use Flowise's [Docker Compose File](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/main/metrics/otel/compose.yaml).

     ```bash
     cd Flowise/metrics/otel
     docker compose up -d
     ```

   - Collector configuration: [otel.config.yml](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/main/metrics/otel/otel.config.yml)

3. **Exporter Setup**

   You can export data to supported tools like:
   - [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
   - Prometheus

   For other tools (Zipkin, Jaeger, New Relic, Splunk), follow the [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/exporters/).

### Conclusion

Monitoring is your secret weapon for running Flowise smoothly and fixing issues quickly. By combining Prometheus for data collection, Grafana for visualization, and OpenTelemetry for flexibility, you can keep your Flowise instance happy, healthy, and easy to manage.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Start monitoring early—don’t wait for problems!
- Prometheus and Grafana make monitoring simple and visual.
- OpenTelemetry offers advanced options for bigger setups.

### FAQ

**Q1: Do I need all three tools—Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry—to monitor Flowise?**  
*No. Prometheus and Grafana are a popular combo for most needs. OpenTelemetry is helpful for complex or multi-platform setups.*

**Q2: What is a 'metric'?**  
*A metric is just a number that measures something—like how many requests your app gets or how much memory it uses.*

**Q3: What should I do if my dashboard doesn’t show any metrics?**  
*Check that Flowise and Prometheus are running, confirm your `.env` settings, and make sure the metric endpoint (`/api/v1/metrics`) is live. For more help, try [Flowise documentation](https://docs.flowiseai.com/).*
