## 🌟 Introduction

Imagine being able to create your own ChatGPT-like AI tools — but without writing tons of code or setting up complex infrastructure. That’s what **[Flowise](https://flowiseai.com)** helps you do!

Flowise is a low-code platform that lets you visually build and deploy AI applications powered by **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and more. But before you can start building, you’ll need to set it up — either in the **cloud** or **on your local machine**.

In this guide, we’ll walk you step by step through:

* What Flowise Cloud and Self-Hosting mean
* How to install Flowise using **NPM** or **Docker**
* How developers can set up the project manually using **PNPM**
* Extra tips for enterprise users and contributors

Let’s get you up and running!

## ☁️ 1. Using Flowise Cloud — The Quick & Easy Way

If you don’t want to deal with servers, terminals, or code setup, this is for you.

**Flowise Cloud** is a hosted version managed by the Flowise team. You just sign up and start building right away — no installation needed.

👉 Try it here: [Flowise Cloud](https://cloud.flowiseai.com)

**Why use the cloud version?**

* No maintenance — everything’s updated automatically
* Your data and workflows are safely backed up
* Perfect for beginners or non-developers

However, if you want full control over your environment (like customizing code or connecting to private databases), you can install Flowise locally.

## 💻 2. Installing Flowise Locally with Node.js

This is the best option if you’re a developer who wants to customize or host Flowise on your own server.

### ✅ Step 1: Install Node.js

Download and install Node.js from the official website:
👉 [NodeJS Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Make sure you’re using **Node v18.15.0** or **v20+**.

### ✅ Step 2: Install Flowise

Once Node.js is ready, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g flowise
```

If you want a specific version (for example, v1.2.3), use:

```bash
npm install -g flowise@1.2.3
```

You can check all available versions here:
👉 [Flowise on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flowise?activeTab=versions)

### ✅ Step 3: Start Flowise

Launch it with:

```bash
npx flowise start
```

Then open your browser and visit:
👉 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That’s it — you now have Flowise running locally!

## 🐳 3. Running Flowise with Docker

Docker is perfect if you prefer using containers for quick setup and deployment. There are **two** ways to do it:

### ⚙️ Option 1: Docker Compose

1. Clone the project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise
   ```
2. Go to the `docker` folder.
3. Copy `.env.example` → rename it to `.env`.
4. Start everything with:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
5. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access Flowise.
6. To stop it:

   ```bash
   docker compose stop
   ```

### ⚙️ Option 2: Docker Image

1. Build an image:

   ```bash
   docker build --no-cache -t flowise .
   ```
2. Run it:

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name flowise -p 3000:3000 flowise
   ```
3. Stop it anytime:

   ```bash
   docker stop flowise
   ```

* **Components**: integration connectors
* **API Documentation**: Swagger documentation for APIs

If you want to contribute or explore the code deeply, follow these steps.

### 🧰 Prerequisite: Install PNPM

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```
