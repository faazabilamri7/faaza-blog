Have you ever wanted your AI chatbot to do more than just answer questions? Imagine if it could check the weather, create calendar events, search databases, or even interact with GitHub repositories. Sounds complicated, right? Well, it's easier than you think!

In this guide, we'll explore how to give your AI superpowers using **Tools** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** in Flowise. Don't worry if these terms sound technical—by the end of this article, you'll understand exactly what they mean and how to use them, even if you're a complete beginner.

## What Are Tools in Flowise?

Think of tools as special abilities you can give to your AI chatbot. Just like how a Swiss Army knife has different tools for different jobs, your AI can have various tools to perform specific tasks.

**Here's a simple analogy:** 
Imagine you have a personal assistant who's great at conversation but can't actually *do* anything—they can't send emails, book appointments, or look up information. Tools are like giving that assistant access to your email, calendar, and phone so they can actually take action on your behalf.

Flowise comes with a library of **prebuilt tools** that you can plug into your chatbot right away. These include things like:
- Weather checkers
- Calculator functions
- Database connectors
- Web scrapers
- And many more!

You can find the full list in the [Flowise Tools documentation](https://docs.flowiseai.com/integrations/langchain/tools).

But what if the tool you need doesn't exist yet? That's where **Custom Tools** come in.

## Creating Your First Custom Tool

Let's say you're running an event management company, and you want your chatbot to create events in your system when users ask. Flowise doesn't have a built-in "create event" tool, so we'll build one ourselves.

### The Building Blocks of a Custom Tool

Every custom tool has four main parts:

**1. Tool Name**
This is what your AI will "see" as the tool's identifier. Keep it simple and descriptive.
- Example: `create_event`

**2. Tool Description**
This tells the AI *when* to use this tool. Be clear and specific!
- Example: "Use this when you want to create a new event."

**3. Input Schema**
Think of this as a form that defines what information the tool needs. It's written in JSON format (a structured way to organize data).

For our event creator, we might need:
- Event name
- Location
- Date

**4. JavaScript Function**
This is the actual code that runs when the tool is called. Don't worry if you're not a programmer—you can often copy and adapt examples!

### A Real Example: Event Creation Tool

Here's what the code looks like for creating an event:

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const url = 'http://localhost:5566/events';
const options = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: $name,
      location: $location,
      date: $date
    })
};
try {
    const response = await fetch(url, options);
    const text = await response.text();
    return text;
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return '';
}
```

**What's happening here?**
- The code sends information to your event management server
- It packages the event details (name, location, date) in a format the server understands
- It waits for a response and returns the result

Notice those variables with dollar signs (`$name`, `$location`, `$date`)? Those automatically pull information from the Input Schema. Pretty smart, right?

### Pro Tips for Custom Tool Functions

Here are some handy things you can do in your functions:

**Access special information:**
- `$flow.sessionId` - Unique ID for the conversation session
- `$flow.chatId` - Unique ID for the specific chat
- `$flow.chatflowId` - ID of your chatflow setup
- `$flow.input` - The user's original message
- `$flow.state` - Current state of the conversation

**Use custom variables:**
- `$vars.<variable-name>` - Access any variables you've created

**Important rule:** Your function must always return a text string at the end!

## Using Your Custom Tool

Once you've created your custom tool, you have two ways to use it:

### Option 1: With an Agent (Smart Mode)

An **Agent** is like giving your AI a brain that can decide which tool to use based on the conversation. 

**How it works:**
1. Add an Agent node to your Flowise canvas
2. Select your custom tool from the Tool dropdown
3. The AI will automatically figure out when to use it

**Example conversation:**
- User: "Can you create an event called 'Team Lunch' at the downtown office on Friday?"
- AI: *Uses the create_event tool automatically*
- AI: "I've created the event 'Team Lunch' at downtown office for Friday!"

**Bonus feature:** Turn on **Return Direct** if you want the tool's output to go straight to the user without the AI rephrasing it.

### Option 2: As a Standalone Tool Node (Manual Mode)

Sometimes you want more control. Instead of letting the AI decide, you can explicitly call the tool at a specific point in your workflow.

**The catch:** You need to fill in all the values yourself—there's no AI to figure them out for you.

**When to use this:**
- Automated workflows
- When you know exactly what data to pass
- Integration with other systems

For more details on this approach, check out the [Interacting with API tutorial](https://docs.flowiseai.com/tutorials/interacting-with-api).

## What Is MCP? (The Game Changer)

Now here's where things get really exciting. **MCP stands for Model Context Protocol**, and it's revolutionizing how AI connects to external services.

### The Simple Explanation

Imagine if there was a universal standard that allowed any AI application to connect to any tool or data source—like having a universal USB port for your AI. That's exactly what MCP does!

Instead of building custom tools for every single integration you need, you can use **MCP servers** that have already been created and are maintained by official providers.

**Real-world examples:**
- **GitHub MCP** - Created and maintained by GitHub
- **Atlassian Jira MCP** - Maintained by Atlassian
- **Brave Search MCP** - Maintained by Brave

These are industry-standard connections that just work. You can browse available MCP servers at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples).

### Why MCP Is Better Than Custom Tools

**Think of it this way:**

**Custom Tools** = Building your own bridge from scratch every time you need to cross a river

**MCP** = Using existing, professionally-maintained bridges that everyone can access

**Benefits of MCP:**
- **Reliability**: Maintained by official providers
- **Updates**: Automatically get new features and bug fixes
- **Standardization**: Works the same way across different platforms
- **Community**: Benefit from shared solutions

## Understanding MCP Architecture

Let's break down how MCP works using simple roles:

**Hosts** (like Flowise)
- These are the AI applications that want to use tools
- They start the connection process

**Clients** (like Custom MCP in Flowise)
- These maintain the connection to servers
- One client connects to one server at a time

**Servers** (like GitHub MCP)
- These provide the actual tools and data
- They're created by service providers or community developers

### How They Talk to Each Other

MCP uses two main communication methods:

**1. Stdio Transport**
- Uses your computer's standard input/output (like a command line)
- Great for local, desktop applications
- **Best for**: Running Flowise on your own computer

**2. Streamable HTTP Transport** ⭐ *Recommended*
- Uses web protocols (HTTP) to communicate
- Works anywhere, including cloud deployments
- **Best for**: Professional deployments and cloud services

## Setting Up Custom MCP (Step by Step)

Let's walk through a real example: connecting to GitHub's MCP server so your AI can interact with repositories.

### Method 1: Stdio (Local Setup)

**When to use this:** Only when running Flowise on your local computer, not for cloud deployments.

**Why?** Running commands like `npx` installs packages locally, which takes time and isn't suitable for cloud environments.

**NPX Command Example:**
```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "-y",
    "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
  ]
}
```

**Docker Command Example:**
```json
{
  "command": "docker",
  "args": [
    "run",
    "-i",
    "--rm",
    "mcp/sequentialthinking"
  ]
}
```

Docker MCP servers are available at [Docker Hub MCP Catalog](https://hub.docker.com/catalogs/mcp).

**Windows users:** Check out this [helpful setup guide](https://gist.github.com/feveromo/7a340d7795fca1ccd535a5802b976e1f).

### Method 2: Streamable HTTP (Recommended for Everyone)

This is the professional approach that works everywhere. Let's use GitHub as our example.

**Step 1: Get Your GitHub Personal Access Token**

Think of this as a special password that gives your chatbot permission to access GitHub on your behalf.

1. Go to your GitHub settings
2. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) following [GitHub's official guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)
3. Copy the token—you'll need it in a moment

**Step 2: Create a Variable in Flowise**

For security, we don't want to paste our token directly into the chatbot. Instead, we'll store it as a variable.

1. Go to Flowise variables section
2. Create a new variable (e.g., `githubPAT`)
3. Paste your GitHub token as the value
4. Save it

Now your token is stored securely and can be reused across different chatflows!

**Step 3: Configure Custom MCP**

1. Create an Agent node in your Flowise canvas
2. Add a new Custom MCP tool
3. Enter the MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer {{$vars.githubPAT}}"
  }
}
```

**Notice the special syntax:** `{{$vars.githubPAT}}` tells Flowise to insert your saved variable here.

**Step 4: Load Available Actions**

Click the **Refresh Available Actions** button. Like magic, Flowise will connect to GitHub's MCP server and pull in all available actions!

You'll see options like:
- Search repositories
- Get issues
- Create pull requests
- Update files
- And many more!

**Step 5: Select the Actions You Want**

Choose which GitHub actions your AI should have access to. You don't need to select all of them—just pick what's relevant for your use case.

### Seeing It in Action

**User:** "Give me the most recent issue"

**Behind the scenes:**
1. The AI recognizes this needs GitHub data
2. It selects the appropriate MCP action
3. It fetches the information
4. It presents it in a friendly format

**AI Response:** "The most recent issue is #1234: 'Fix login bug on mobile devices' created 2 hours ago by user_123."

The best part? The GitHub MCP is hosted remotely by GitHub itself, so it's always up-to-date with new features and fixes automatically!

## When to Use Stdio vs HTTP Transport

Let me make this super clear with a simple comparison:

**Use Stdio When:**
- ✅ Running Flowise on your personal computer
- ✅ Building desktop integrations (like Claude Desktop or VS Code)
- ✅ Testing locally before deployment
- ✅ You have Docker installed and running
- ✅ Need simple, direct process communication

**Use Streamable HTTP When:**
- ✅ Deploying to cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.)
- ✅ Building web-based integrations
- ✅ Need to support multiple users simultaneously
- ✅ Want automatic updates from providers
- ✅ Require professional, production-grade reliability
- ✅ Working with officially hosted MCP servers

**In 99% of cases, HTTP is the better choice for production applications.**

## Real-World Use Cases

Let's look at some practical scenarios where Tools and MCP shine:

**1. Customer Support Automation**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

As you start building with Tools and MCP, watch out for these pitfalls:

**❌ Making tool descriptions too vague**
- Bad: "Does stuff with events"
- Good: "Use this when you want to create a new event with a name, location, and date"

**❌ Not handling errors in your functions**
- Always include `try/catch` blocks
- Return meaningful error messages

**❌ Forgetting to return a string**
- Your function MUST return text
- Even if it's just "Success!" or "Task completed"

**❌ Using Stdio for cloud deployments**
- It won't work reliably
- Always use HTTP for production

**❌ Giving the AI too many tools at once**
- More isn't always better
- The AI can get confused with too many options
- Start with 3-5 essential tools and expand as needed

**❌ Not securing your API tokens**
- Always use variables for sensitive data
- Never hardcode tokens directly in your code

## Troubleshooting Tips

**Problem:** "My custom tool isn't being called"

**Solutions:**
- Check if your tool description clearly explains when to use it
- Make sure the Input Schema matches what your function expects
- Test with explicit requests: "Use the create_event tool to..."

**Problem:** "MCP server won't connect"

**Solutions:**
- Verify your authentication token is correct
- Check that the URL is exactly right (no typos!)
- Ensure your network allows outbound connections
- Try refreshing the Available Actions button

**Problem:** "Function returns an error"

**Solutions:**
- Check your function's error handling
- Verify all required variables are being passed
- Test the API endpoint separately to ensure it's working
- Look at Flowise logs for detailed error messages

## Conclusion: Your AI Just Got Superpowers

Congratulations! You now understand how to transform a basic chatbot into a powerful AI assistant that can actually *do things* in the real world.

**Key Takeaways:**

✅ **Tools** give your AI the ability to take actions beyond just conversation

✅ **Custom Tools** let you create specific integrations when prebuilt options don't exist

✅ **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a game-changing standard that connects your AI to professionally-maintained services

The beauty of this system is that it scales with your needs. Start simple with one or two tools, then gradually add more capabilities as you become comfortable.

Remember: you don't need to be a programming expert to use these features. Start with examples, adapt them to your needs, and don't be afraid to experiment. The worst that can happen is you'll need to adjust your configuration—you won't break anything!

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Do I need to know programming to create custom tools?**

Not necessarily! While basic JavaScript knowledge helps, you can often find examples and adapt them to your needs. The Flowise community is very helpful, and many tutorials provide copy-paste solutions. Start with simple tools and gradually learn as you go.

**Q2: What's the difference between using a custom tool and MCP?**

Think of custom tools as building your own solution from scratch—you have complete control but also do all the work. MCP is like using pre-built, professionally maintained solutions that are standardized and automatically updated. MCP is usually easier and more reliable, but custom tools give you flexibility when MCP options don't exist for your specific need.

**Q3: Can I use multiple MCP servers in one chatbot?**

Absolutely! You can connect to as many MCP servers as you need. For example, you could have GitHub MCP for code management, Jira MCP for project tracking, and a weather MCP for real-time forecasts—all in the same AI assistant. Just be mindful not to overwhelm the AI with too many options at once.
