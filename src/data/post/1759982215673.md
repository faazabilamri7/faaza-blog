# AgentFlow V2 Explained: A Friendly Guide to the Next Generation of Workflow Automation

Are you curious about AgentFlow V2 and how it revolutionizes workflow automation, especially for AI-powered projects? Whether you have some experience with tools like Zapier or n8n, or you’re just hearing about AI agents and workflow orchestration for the first time, this article will walk you through AgentFlow V2—from its main concepts to its practical uses. We'll break down each part into simple, digestible sections and finish with practical tips and answers to your most common questions.

## Introduction: What Is AgentFlow V2, and Why Should You Care?

Imagine you’re building a system where digital assistants (called "agents") talk to each other, make decisions, fetch information, and sometimes wait for your approval before acting. Traditionally, automation platforms like Zapier string together apps and data. But AgentFlow V2 goes further: it lets you design powerful, flexible workflows that use AI, fetch live data, handle approvals, and even “loop” over tasks—all with clear, visual control.

AgentFlow V2 is the latest architecture by Flowise, shifting away from large, monolithic agent frameworks. Instead, it offers you a toolkit of simple, independent "nodes" you connect visually—like building a LEGO model, but for smart workflows. Each node has a specific job, from chatting with AI to querying your documents or integrating with other web apps.

If you want workflows that are easy to understand, modify, and scale, AgentFlow V2 is a game-changer. Let's see why!

## AgentFlow V2: Breaking Down the Basics

### 1. How Is AgentFlow V2 Different?

Think of AgentFlow V2 like a group project where each member has clear instructions and responsibilities. In old systems, a lot of logic was hidden inside big frameworks. Now:

- **Every workflow step is a simple, standalone node**  
  Example: Before, you might have a single “automation” block that did a bunch of things. With V2, you see every operation—a chat with AI, a database lookup, an approval request—as a separate block you can move, modify, or connect.

- **Workflows are visual and explicit**  
  Like drawing a flowchart, each arrow between nodes shows exactly how data and actions move.

- **‘Flow State’ shares data between steps**  
  Have you ever wanted one part of your workflow to “remember” something for later? Flow State acts like a shared notebook—nodes can write or read info any time.

### 2. What Can AgentFlow V2 Do?

Here’s what makes it special:

- **Agent-to-Agent Communication:**  
  Agents (AI entities) talk to each other. Think of a supervisor assigning tasks to workers, reviewing their work, and guiding the process. This collaborative power is rare in classic automation tools ([see it in action](https://youtu.be/-h4WQuzRHhI?si=jKkhueFIw06aO6Ge)).

- **Human-in-the-Loop:**  
  Workflows pause for human approvals or input. For example, before sending an important email, the system asks you for confirmation and waits, instead of running off unattended.

- **Branching and Conditionals:**  
  The system can ask things like: “Is the customer VIP?” or “Did the tool return an error?” and follow different paths based on the answer.

- **Loops and Iterations:**  
  Need to process a list of items one-by-one? The flow can “loop,” so you don’t have to repeat yourself.

- **Direct Tool Integration:**  
  You can run a tool (like a calculator or API) at any step—no need for an AI to figure out what to do.

- **Real-Time Streaming:**  
  Get live updates as your workflow runs, great for AI responses ([learn more](https://youtu.be/SLVVDUIbIBE?si=VU1m_btfDzVNl-PP)).

- **Industry-Standard Integrations:**  
  Attach Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, like GitHub, Jira, or Brave Search, and use them within your workflow ([see more about MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)).

## AgentFlow vs. Traditional Automation: What’s Different?

Let’s compare AgentFlow V2 with classic platforms you may know:

| Platform        | Can Talk Between AI Agents? | Human Approvals | Flexible Data Sharing | Streaming Responses | Tool Integration Type    |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Zapier, n8n     | ❌                          | Limited         | Linear (step to step)| ❌                  | Only platform-provided  |
| AgentFlow V2    | ✅ Supervisor-Worker Model  | ✅ With Pause   | Flexible ‘Flow State’| ✅ Live              | Open, with MCP standard |

If your project needs multi-step AI reasoning, human intervention, or advanced branching, AgentFlow V2 is designed for you.

## Meet Your Workflow Building Blocks: The Node Reference

AgentFlow V2 workflows are built from “nodes.” Each node is like a specialist with a particular job. Here is a beginner’s summary of each:

### 1. Start Node: Entry Point

- **What it does:** Defines how you start the flow—by chat or form—and sets up any initial data ("Flow State").
- **Analogy:** Like the sign-in page or first question in a survey.
- **Tip:** Always start your workflow here!

### 2. LLM Node: Talk to AI

- **What it does:** Sends questions or prompts to a large language model (like ChatGPT) and gets its answer in text or structured format.
- **Example:** “Summarize this customer complaint,” or “Translate this message to Spanish.”

### 3. Agent Node: AI Reasoning Engine

- **What it does:** The "generalist" node—can think, plan, pick tools, fetch info, and make multi-step decisions.
- **Example:** Give it a customer request, let it decide what tool to use, which database to query, and how to respond.

### 4. Tool Node: Run a Specific Tool

- **What it does:** Executes a chosen capability, such as a calculator or API call, using exact inputs.
- **Analogy:** Like pushing a button on a vending machine knowing exactly what you’ll get.

### 5. Retriever Node: Search Documents

- **What it does:** Looks up information in your document storage by keyword or question.
- **Example:** “Find all documents mentioning ‘refund policy’.”

### 6. HTTP Node: Call External APIs

- **What it does:** Sends requests to other web services (GET, POST, etc.).
- **Example:** Grab weather data from a public API.

### 7. Condition Node: Branch Logic

- **What it does:** Makes Yes/No or multi-choice decisions based on defined rules.
- **Analogy:** Like an “if” statement: “If customer is VIP, do X; else do Y.”

### 8. Condition Agent Node: Smart Branching

- **What it does:** Asks an AI to choose the best path using natural language instructions.
- **Example:** “Is this message a sales inquiry or a support request?”

### 9–10. Iteration & Loop Nodes: Repeat Steps

- **Iteration Node:** Runs a sub-flow for each item in a list (like processing multiple orders).
- **Loop Node:** Makes your workflow go back and retry a step (e.g., if a tool fails, retry up to 5 times).
- **Example:** “Send reminder email to each contact in the list.”

### 11. Human Input Node: Ask Human for Action

- **What it does:** Pauses to collect info or approval from a person.
- **Analogy:** Like the “Are you sure?” pop-up before deleting something important.

### 12. Direct Reply Node: Finish and Respond

- **What it does:** Sends a message directly to the user and ends this path of the workflow.

### 13. Custom Function Node: Write Your Own Logic

- **What it does:** Lets you run custom JavaScript, for unique data processing.

### 14. Execute Flow Node: Call Another Workflow

- **What it does:** Invokes a separate workflow and uses its result.

## Understanding “Flow State”: Your Workflow Memory

Imagine Flow State ($flow.state) as a shared digital notepad for your workflow run:

- **Initialization:** All the “pages” (keys) you’ll use must be set up in the Start Node.
- **Updating:** Nodes can write info to the notepad using an “Update Flow State” setting.
- **Reading:** Any node can grab a value using {{ $flow.state.yourKey }}.
- **Scope:** The notepad is wiped clean after the workflow finishes; it’s private for each run.

Use Flow State whenever you want a later step to “remember” something set earlier, even if it’s on a different branch.

---

## Practical Example: Building a Smart Customer Support Flow

Let’s walk through a sample workflow:

1. **Start Node:** Collects customer question.
2. **LLM Node:** Uses AI to summarize the issue.
3. **Condition Node:** Checks if the customer is VIP.
4. **Agent Node:** For VIP, invokes extra support tools (calls Agent).
5. **Human Input Node:** Pauses for support agent to approve a refund.
6. **Direct Reply Node:** Delivers final answer to customer.

Each step writes or reads info from Flow State. Need to process multiple tickets? Use the Iteration Node!
