- What Flowise Analytics is
- Why analytics matter in AI projects
- How to set up popular analytics providers, like Arize and Phoenix

## What is Flowise Analytics and Why Should You Care?

Imagine you’ve built a chatbot that helps people order pizza. Someone asks, “What’s on the veggie pizza?” and your bot gets confused and starts listing soda flavors! Oops.

**Without analytics**, you might never know this happened, or why.  
**With analytics**, you can:

- **Trace conversations step by step:** See exactly how your bot arrived at its answers
- **Spot and fix mistakes:** Catch errors before users do
- **Track performance over time:** See how your AI improves after tweaks

Flowise makes this easy by connecting to several analytics tools that act like “fitness trackers” for your chatbot or agent.
