## Introduction

You know that feeling when you buy something that requires assembly, open the box, and see a thousand parts with confusing instructions? That's how many people feel when they first try to set up Kubernetes.

But here's the good news: **it doesn't have to be that hard.**

In this hands-on guide, we're going to set up a real Kubernetes cluster on your local machine—and we'll do it in a way that makes sense, step by step, with no confusing jargon left unexplained.

By the end of this article, you'll have:

- A fully functional development environment with all necessary tools
- A local Kubernetes cluster running on your computer
- Practical experience deploying and managing Kubernetes resources
- The confidence to experiment and learn more

**Best of all?** This entire setup is **completely free** and runs on your own computer—no cloud account or credit card required!

**Source:** This guide is based on the setup sections of the [Complete Kubernetes Course - From Beginner to Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T86xAtR6Fo&t=1348s) by DevOps Directive (timestamp 22:28 - 36:38).

## Why Set Up Locally First?

Before we dive into the setup, you might wonder: "Why create a local cluster? Why not just use a cloud provider?"

Great question! Here's why starting locally is a smart move:

✅ **Zero cost** - No cloud bills, no credit card needed
✅ **Fast iteration** - Experiment, break things, and learn without consequences
✅ **No internet required** - Work anywhere, even offline
✅ **Learn the fundamentals** - Understand how Kubernetes works without cloud-specific complexity
✅ **Safe sandbox** - Can't accidentally rack up a cloud bill or expose something to the internet

**The bottom line:** Once you're comfortable with local Kubernetes, moving to the cloud is straightforward. But starting locally gives you a risk-free playground to learn.

## What We'll Be Installing

Before we start clicking and typing, let's understand what we're installing and why:

### 1. **Docker Desktop**

- **What:** A tool that lets you run containers on your computer
- **Why:** Kubernetes runs containers, so we need a container runtime
- **Analogy:** If Kubernetes is a restaurant manager, Docker is the kitchen equipment

### 2. **Devbox**

- **What:** A tool that manages development dependencies
- **Why:** Ensures everyone uses the same tool versions (no "works on my machine" problems)
- **Analogy:** Like a recipe that includes the exact brand and amount of each ingredient

### 3. **Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)**

- **What:** A tool that creates Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers
- **Why:** Lightweight, fast, perfect for learning and development
- **Analogy:** A flight simulator for pilots—realistic practice in a safe environment

### 4. **kubectl**

- **What:** The command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes
- **Why:** This is how you'll give commands to your cluster
- **Analogy:** The steering wheel and pedals for driving your Kubernetes "car"

### 5. **Various other CLI tools**

- **What:** Additional utilities for working with Kubernetes
- **Why:** Make common tasks easier
- **Examples:** `helm`, `k9s`, `kubectx`, and more (we'll explain these as we use them)

Don't worry about understanding everything right now. We'll explore each tool as we use it!

## Prerequisites: What You Need Before Starting

Before we begin, make sure you have:

### **Hardware Requirements**

- **RAM:** At least 8GB (16GB recommended for comfortable use)
- **Disk space:** At least 20GB free
- **CPU:** Any modern processor (last 5-7 years)

### **Operating System**

- **Mac:** macOS 10.14 or newer
- **Windows:** Windows 10/11 (we'll use WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- **Linux:** Any recent distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)

### **Software Requirements**

- A **terminal/command line** application
- A **text editor** (VS Code is recommended and free)
- Basic familiarity with using the command line

### **Knowledge Prerequisites**

- Comfortable using the terminal for basic tasks
- Understanding of what containers are (Docker basics)
- Patience and willingness to troubleshoot

**Don't meet all the knowledge prerequisites?** That's okay! Take the time to learn Docker basics first with the [Complete Docker Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqTEHSBrYFw) by the same instructor.

## Step 1: Installing Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is the foundation of our setup. It provides the container runtime that Kind will use.

### For **macOS:**

1. **Download Docker Desktop:**
   - Go to [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
   - Download the version for your Mac (Intel chip or Apple Silicon)

2. **Install it:**
   - Open the downloaded `.dmg` file
   - Drag Docker to your Applications folder
   - Launch Docker Desktop from Applications

3. **Verify installation:**
   Open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```
   You should see something like: `Docker version 24.0.6`

### For **Windows:**

1. **Install WSL 2 first:**
   Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

   Restart your computer when prompted.

2. **Download Docker Desktop:**
   - Go to [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
   - Download Docker Desktop for Windows

3. **Install it:**
   - Run the installer
   - Ensure "Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V" is selected
   - Complete the installation and restart

4. **Verify installation:**
   Open WSL (Ubuntu) and run:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

### For **Linux:**

Follow the instructions for your specific distribution at [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem:** "Docker daemon is not running"
**Solution:** Make sure Docker Desktop is actually running (you should see the Docker icon in your menu bar/system tray)

**Problem:** Permission errors on Linux
**Solution:** Add your user to the docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Then log out and log back in.

## Step 2: Installing Devbox

Devbox helps us install and manage all our development tools in an isolated, reproducible way.

### Installation

**For Mac or Linux:**

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.jetify.com/devbox | bash
```

This downloads and runs an installation script. You'll be asked to confirm—type `yes` and press Enter.

**For Windows (WSL):**

Same command as above, but run it inside your WSL terminal (Ubuntu):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.jetify.com/devbox | bash
```

### Verify Installation

After installation, run:

```bash
devbox version
```

You should see a version number, confirming it's installed correctly.

### What Just Happened?

Devbox installed itself and prepared to manage other tools. Think of it like setting up a tool chest that will hold all your specialized tools in organized compartments.

## Step 3: Clone the Course Repository

All the configurations and examples for the course are stored in a GitHub repository. Let's download it!

### Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sidpalas/devops-directive-kubernetes-course.git
cd devops-directive-kubernetes-course
```

**Don't have Git installed?**

- **Mac:** Install with `brew install git` (if you have Homebrew) or download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
- **Windows:** Included with WSL
- **Linux:** Install with your package manager (`sudo apt install git` on Ubuntu)

### What's in This Repository?

The repo contains:

- **Configuration files** for Devbox
- **Example Kubernetes configurations** for all lessons
- **Task files** with pre-written commands
- **Documentation** for each module

Everything you need to follow along!

## Step 4: Set Up Your Development Tools with Devbox

Now comes the magic—Devbox will install all the necessary CLI tools automatically!

### Initialize Devbox Shell

In your terminal (make sure you're in the cloned repository folder), run:

```bash
devbox shell
```

**The first time you run this, it will take several minutes** (maybe 5-10 minutes depending on your internet connection). Devbox is downloading and installing:

- kubectl (Kubernetes CLI)
- kind (Kubernetes in Docker)
- helm (Kubernetes package manager)
- k9s (terminal-based Kubernetes UI)
- kubectx/kubens (context and namespace switchers)
- And several other helpful tools

**What's happening behind the scenes?**

Devbox is:

1. Reading the `devbox.json` file to see what tools are needed
2. Downloading those specific versions from the Nix package repository
3. Installing them in an isolated environment
4. Configuring your shell to use these tools

### Verify Your Tools

Once the Devbox shell is ready, verify the tools are installed:

```bash
kubectl version --client
kind version
helm version
```

Each command should return version information, confirming the tool is installed and accessible.

### Understanding the Devbox Shell

**Important concept:** When you run `devbox shell`, you enter a special environment where all these tools are available. When you exit (by typing `exit` or closing the terminal), those tools disappear from your normal shell.

**Why?** This keeps your system clean and prevents version conflicts between different projects.

**To activate the Devbox shell in the future:**
Every time you open a new terminal and want to work on Kubernetes, navigate to the project folder and run `devbox shell` again.

## Step 5: Create Your First Kubernetes Cluster with Kind

Now for the exciting part—creating an actual Kubernetes cluster on your computer!

### Understanding Kind

**Kind** stands for "Kubernetes in Docker." It creates Kubernetes clusters where each "node" is actually a Docker container.

**Why is this cool?**

- Super fast to create and destroy clusters
- Uses minimal resources
- Can simulate multi-node clusters on a single machine
- Perfect for testing and learning

### The Cluster Configuration

The course repository includes a configuration file for our Kind cluster. Let's look at what it does:

**File location:** `03-running-kubernetes/kind/cluster-config.yaml.template`

This configuration specifies:

- **1 control plane node** - Runs Kubernetes management components
- **2 worker nodes** - Run your actual applications
- **Extra mounts** - Directories from your computer mounted into the nodes

### Generate the Configuration

The repository uses a task runner called `task` to simplify commands. Let's use it!

**Navigate to the module folder:**

```bash
cd 03-running-kubernetes
```

**List available tasks:**

```bash
task --list
```

You'll see several tasks related to Kind clusters.

**Generate the cluster config:**

```bash
task kind:01-generate-config
```

This creates a `cluster-config.yaml` file with paths customized for your system.

### Create the Cluster

Now run:

```bash
task kind:02-create-cluster
```

**What's happening?**

You'll see output like:

```
Creating cluster "kind" ...
 ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.27.3) 🖼
 ✓ Preparing nodes 📦 📦 📦
 ✓ Writing configuration 📜
 ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️
 ✓ Installing CNI 🔌
 ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾
 ✓ Joining worker nodes 🚜
Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind
```

**This process takes 30-90 seconds.** Kind is:

1. Pulling Docker images for the Kubernetes nodes
2. Creating 3 Docker containers (1 control plane + 2 workers)
3. Configuring Kubernetes on each node
4. Setting up networking between nodes
5. Installing necessary add-ons

### Verify Your Cluster

Check that your cluster is running:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see output like:

```
NAME                 STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
kind-control-plane   Ready    control-plane   60s   v1.27.3
kind-worker          Ready    <none>          45s   v1.27.3
kind-worker2         Ready    <none>          45s   v1.27.3
```

**Congratulations! You now have a working Kubernetes cluster!** 🎉

## Step 6: Explore Your Cluster

Let's interact with your new cluster and understand what's running.

### View System Pods

Kubernetes itself runs several components as pods. Let's see them:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

You'll see output showing pods in the `kube-system` namespace:

```
NAMESPACE     NAME                                         READY   STATUS
kube-system   coredns-5d78c9869d-abc12                    1/1     Running
kube-system   coredns-5d78c9869d-def34                    1/1     Running
kube-system   etcd-kind-control-plane                      1/1     Running
kube-system   kindnet-abc12                                1/1     Running
kube-system   kindnet-def34                                1/1     Running
kube-system   kindnet-ghi56                                1/1     Running
kube-system   kube-apiserver-kind-control-plane            1/1     Running
kube-system   kube-controller-manager-kind-control-plane   1/1     Running
kube-system   kube-proxy-abc12                             1/1     Running
kube-system   kube-proxy-def34                             1/1     Running
kube-system   kube-proxy-ghi56                             1/1     Running
kube-system   kube-scheduler-kind-control-plane            1/1     Running
```

**Recognize some of these?** They're the components we discussed in the architecture article!

- `etcd` - The database
- `kube-apiserver` - The API server
- `kube-controller-manager` - The controller manager
- `kube-scheduler` - The scheduler
- `kube-proxy` - Handles networking
- `coredns` - DNS for service discovery
- `kindnet` - Kind's networking plugin (CNI)

### Check Cluster Info

Get more details about your cluster:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

This shows you where the Kubernetes API server is running and other cluster services.

### View Cluster Context

Kubernetes uses "contexts" to manage connections to different clusters. See your current context:

```bash
kubectl config current-context
```

Should show: `kind-kind`

This means kubectl is currently talking to your Kind cluster.

## Understanding What You Just Built

Let's break down what's actually running on your machine:

### At the Docker Level

Run:

```bash
docker ps
```

You'll see 3 containers:

- `kind-control-plane` - Running the control plane components
- `kind-worker` - First worker node
- `kind-worker2` - Second worker node

**Each container is acting as a "node" in your cluster!**

### At the Kubernetes Level

Inside those containers, Kubernetes is running and managing pods. You can deploy applications to these "nodes" just like you would in a production cluster with real servers.

### The Beautiful Illusion

From Kubernetes' perspective, it thinks it's running on three separate machines. But actually, it's all happening in Docker containers on your laptop!

**This is why Kind is amazing for learning—you get a realistic multi-node cluster without needing multiple machines.**

## Common Commands You'll Use Daily

Here are the essential commands you'll use all the time:

### Check Cluster Status

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### View All Pods

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

### Get Detailed Info

```bash
kubectl describe node kind-control-plane
```

### View Logs

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

### Execute Commands in a Pod

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
```

### Delete a Resource

```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```

**Pro tip:** You can create an alias to save typing:

```bash
alias k=kubectl
```

Now instead of typing `kubectl get pods`, you can just type `k get pods`!

## Setting Up for Load Balancers (Optional)

By default, Kind clusters can't expose services via load balancers (that's typically a cloud provider feature). But there's a tool called **Cloud Provider Kind** that simulates this!

### Install Cloud Provider Kind

When you need to test load balancers, run:

```bash
task kind:03-setup-load-balancer
```

This runs a small program on your machine that watches for load balancer services in your Kind cluster and makes them accessible from your host machine.

**When do you need this?** We'll use it later in the course when deploying services that need to be accessible from outside the cluster.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"

**Cause:** Docker Desktop isn't running.

**Solution:**

1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Wait for it to fully start (you'll see a green "running" indicator)
3. Try the Kind command again

### Issue: "Cluster already exists"

**Cause:** You already created a cluster with that name.

**Solution:** Delete the existing cluster first:

```bash
task kind:04-delete-cluster
```

Then create a new one.

### Issue: "Context not found"

**Cause:** The cluster might not have been created successfully.

**Solution:**

1. Check if Docker containers are running: `docker ps`
2. If not, recreate the cluster: `task kind:02-create-cluster`

### Issue: Pods stuck in "Pending" or "ImagePullBackOff"

**Cause:** Resource constraints or network issues.

**Solution:**

1. Check node resources: `kubectl describe node kind-worker`
2. Check pod details: `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`
3. Ensure Docker has enough resources (at least 4GB RAM allocated)

### Issue: Command not found (kubectl, kind, etc.)

**Cause:** Not in the Devbox shell.

**Solution:** Make sure you're in the project directory and run:

```bash
devbox shell
```

## Cleaning Up

When you're done experimenting and want to clean up:

### Delete the Cluster

```bash
task kind:04-delete-cluster
```

This removes all the Docker containers and cleans up the cluster.

### Exit Devbox Shell

```bash
exit
```

### Stop Docker Desktop

If you want to free up resources, quit Docker Desktop from the menu bar/system tray.

**Don't worry—you can recreate everything in under a minute!**

## What's Next?

You now have a fully functional Kubernetes cluster running on your local machine. Here's what you can do next:

### 1. **Deploy Your First Application**

Try deploying a simple web app:

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
```

### 2. **Explore with k9s**

k9s is a terminal-based UI for Kubernetes. Try it:

```bash
k9s
```

Use arrow keys to navigate, `:` to enter commands, and `Ctrl+C` to exit.

### 3. **Follow the Rest of the Course**

Continue with the course to learn about:

- Kubernetes resources (Pods, Deployments, Services)
- Deploying real applications
- Managing configuration
- Debugging issues

### 4. **Experiment Freely**

This is your sandbox! Try things, break stuff, delete it, and recreate it. That's how you learn!

## Conclusion

Let's recap what you accomplished:

✅ **Installed Docker Desktop** - Your container runtime foundation
✅ **Set up Devbox** - A reproducible development environment
✅ **Cloned the course repo** - Access to all examples and configurations
✅ **Installed CLI tools** - kubectl, kind, helm, and more
✅ **Created a multi-node Kubernetes cluster** - Running entirely on your laptop
✅ **Verified it works** - Explored system pods and cluster info

**You went from zero to a working Kubernetes cluster in probably 30-60 minutes.** That's impressive!

More importantly, you now have a **risk-free playground** where you can experiment, learn, and grow your Kubernetes skills without worrying about cloud costs or breaking production systems.

**Remember:** Every Kubernetes expert started exactly where you are right now—with a local cluster and curiosity. The difference is they kept experimenting and learning.

Your Kubernetes journey has truly begun! 🚀

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: How much disk space will the Kind cluster use?**

**A:** Usually 2-4GB for a basic cluster. The Docker images for Kubernetes nodes are fairly small. If disk space is tight, you can delete the cluster when not using it and recreate it when needed (takes less than a minute).

### **Q: Can I have multiple Kind clusters at the same time?**

**A:** Yes! Just give them different names:

```bash
kind create cluster --name cluster1
kind create cluster --name cluster2
```

Switch between them using `kubectl config use-context kind-cluster1`.

### **Q: Will this work on an older computer?**

**A:** It might be slow, but should work on most computers from the last 7-10 years. The key requirement is at least 8GB RAM. If your computer has less, you might struggle.

### **Q: Is Kind suitable for production?**

**A:** No! Kind is specifically designed for development, testing, and learning. For production, use managed services (GKE, EKS, AKS) or production-ready distributions (k3s, RKE2, OpenShift).

### **Q: Do I need to recreate the cluster every time I restart my computer?**

**A:** No! As long as Docker Desktop is running, your Kind cluster persists across reboots. Everything you deployed stays there until you explicitly delete the cluster.
