## Introduction: What is the Flowise API and Why Should You Care?

Imagine you've built a helpful chatbot using Flowise, and now you want to control it from your own app, website, or even automate tasks without touching the Flowise dashboard every time. That's exactly what the **Flowise API** helps you do!

Think of an API (Application Programming Interface) as a messenger that takes your requests, tells Flowise what to do, and brings back the results. It's like having a remote control for your chatbot workflows. Instead of clicking buttons manually, you can write code that does it automatically.

In this guide, we'll explore three powerful features of the Flowise API:

- **Assistants** – Create and manage AI assistants programmatically
- **Variables** – Store and manage dynamic values your chatbots can use
- **Leads** – Collect and track potential customers through your chatflows

By the end of this article, you'll understand how these work, why they're useful, and how to start using them—even if you're not a coding expert!

## What Are Assistants in Flowise?

### The Basics: Your AI Helper

An **Assistant** in Flowise is basically a configured AI chatbot. It has a name, instructions on how to behave, settings for creativity (like temperature), and can use various tools to help users.

Think of it like hiring an employee: you give them a job title (name), a job description (instructions), and the tools they need (like access to search engines or calculators). The Flowise API lets you hire, update, or fire these digital employees automatically!

### What You Can Do with Assistants

Using the Flowise API, you can:

1. **Create new assistants** – Build a fresh AI helper with specific instructions
2. **Get assistant details** – Check what an assistant's current settings are
3. **Update assistants** – Change instructions, models, or tools
4. **Delete assistants** – Remove assistants you no longer need

### Real-World Example

Let's say you run a customer support website. You could create three different assistants:

- **"Billing Support Assistant"** – Handles payment questions
- **"Technical Support Assistant"** – Helps with product troubleshooting  
- **"General Inquiry Assistant"** – Answers basic FAQs

Rather than manually creating each one in the Flowise dashboard, you could write a script that creates all three automatically using the API!

### How to Create an Assistant

Here's what the process looks like:

**What you need to send to Flowise:**
- A unique ID (optional, Flowise can generate one)
- Details like name, description, and model (e.g., GPT-4)
- Instructions telling the AI how to behave
- Settings like temperature (controls creativity: 0 = strict, 1 = creative)
- Tools the assistant can use (like web search or calculations)

**What you get back:**
- Confirmation that your assistant was created
- All the details you submitted, plus timestamps showing when it was created

## What Are Variables in Flowise?

### The Basics: Your Chatbot's Memory

A **Variable** is like a labeled storage box where you keep information your chatbots might need. Instead of hardcoding values (putting them directly in your code), you store them as variables that can change without updating your entire workflow.

For example, imagine you have a chatbot for an online store. You might have variables like:

- `store_name` = "Super Shop"
- `discount_code` = "SAVE20"
- `customer_service_email` = "help@supershop.com"

If your store name changes or you want to update the discount code, you just change the variable—no need to rebuild your entire chatbot!

### What You Can Do with Variables

The API lets you:

1. **Create new variables** – Add new storage boxes with names and values
2. **List all variables** – See everything you've stored
3. **Update variables** – Change values when needed
4. **Delete variables** – Remove ones you no longer use

### Real-World Example

Let's say you run seasonal promotions. Instead of updating your chatbot's code every time you have a new sale, you could:

- Create a variable called `current_promotion`
- Update it monthly: "Summer Sale 30% Off" → "Back to School 25% Off" → "Holiday Special 40% Off"
- Your chatbot automatically uses the current value

This saves hours of manual work and prevents mistakes!

### How Variables Are Structured

Each variable has:

- **ID** – A unique identifier (UUID format)
- **Name** – What you call it (like "discount_code")
- **Value** – The actual data (like "SAVE20")
- **Type** – What kind of data it is (string, number, etc.)
- **Timestamps** – When it was created and last updated

## What Are Leads in Flowise?

### The Basics: Collecting Potential Customers

A **Lead** is information about someone who showed interest in your business through your chatbot. When someone chats with your bot, you might want to collect their name, email, or phone number—that's a lead!

Think of it like having a sign-up sheet at a store event. Instead of paper, your chatbot collects digital contact information automatically.

### What You Can Do with Leads

The API allows you to:

1. **Get all leads for a chatflow** – See everyone who engaged with a specific bot
2. **Create new leads** – Add someone's contact info manually or automatically

### Real-World Example

Imagine you have a chatbot on your website that helps people find the right product. During the conversation, the bot asks:

- "What's your name?" → John Smith
- "What's your email?" → john@email.com  
- "What's your phone?" → +1-555-0123

The bot saves this as a lead and your sales team can follow up later. The API makes it easy to automatically sync these leads with your CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system or email marketing tool.

### How Leads Are Structured

Each lead contains:

- **ID** – Unique identifier for the lead
- **Name** – The person's name
- **Email** – Their email address
- **Phone** – Their phone number
- **Chatflow ID** – Which bot they interacted with
- **Chat ID** – The specific conversation session
- **Created Date** – When they became a lead

**Learn more:** Explore the [Leads API documentation](https://docs.flowiseai.com/api-reference/leads) for integration examples.

## Understanding Authentication: The Security Key

Before you can use any of these APIs, you need **authentication**—basically a special password that proves you're allowed to access your Flowise data.

Flowise uses something called **Bearer Authentication**. Here's how it works:

1. You get an API key (also called a JWT token) from your Flowise account
2. Every time you make an API request, you include this key in the request header
3. Flowise checks the key and allows or denies your request

Think of it like showing your ID card at a secure building. Without it, you can't get in!

**Example of what this looks like:**
```
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here
```

This ensures only you (or people you give the key to) can control your assistants, variables, and leads.

## API Responses: Understanding Success and Errors

When you use the API, Flowise talks back to you with **status codes**—numbers that tell you if things worked or went wrong.

### Common Success Codes

- **200** – Success! Your request worked perfectly
  - Creating an assistant: "Assistant created successfully"
  - Updating a variable: "Variable updated successfully"

### Common Error Codes

- **400** – Bad Request: You sent something wrong
  - Example: "Invalid ID provided" or "Missing required field"
  
- **404** – Not Found: The thing you're looking for doesn't exist
  - Example: "Assistant not found" or "Variable not found"

- **422** – Validation Error: Your data didn't pass the checks
  - Example: Email format is wrong, or required field is missing

- **500** – Internal Server Error: Something went wrong on Flowise's end
  - This usually means there's a technical problem, not your fault!

These codes help you understand what's happening and fix problems quickly.

## Putting It All Together: A Practical Workflow

Let's see how you might use Assistants, Variables, and Leads together:

**Scenario:** You run a pizza delivery service and want an automated ordering chatbot.

**Step 1 - Create the Assistant:**
- Use the Assistants API to create "Pizza Order Assistant"
- Give it instructions: "Help customers order pizza, collect delivery info"
- Set tools: calculator (for pricing), location finder

**Step 2 - Set Up Variables:**
- Create variable: `current_special` = "Buy 2 Large Pizzas Get 1 Free"
- Create variable: `delivery_fee` = "$5"
- Create variable: `estimated_delivery_time` = "30-45 minutes"

Your chatbot can now reference these variables. When your special changes next week, just update the variable!

**Step 3 - Collect Leads:**
- When someone orders, your bot collects: name, phone, email, address
- Save this as a lead using the Leads API
- Your system can automatically add them to your marketing list for future promotions

**Result:** You have an automated system that's easy to update and automatically captures customer information—all without manual work!

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to be a programmer to use the Flowise API?**

A: While some coding knowledge helps, you don't need to be an expert! Basic understanding of HTTP requests and JSON format is enough to get started. There are also many no-code tools (like Zapier or Make.com) that can work with APIs for you.

**Q: Can I use the API for free, or does it cost money?**

A: This depends on your Flowise plan. Check your account settings or contact Flowise support to understand the limits and pricing for API usage. Many plans include API access as standard.

**Q: What happens if I delete an assistant that's currently being used?**

A: If someone is actively chatting with an assistant and you delete it, the conversation might stop working. It's best to create a new assistant with updated settings and gradually migrate users over, rather than deleting active assistants immediately.
