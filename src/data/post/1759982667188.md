## 1. Copy and Paste: The Fastest Way to Add a Chatbot

The easiest way to embed the Flowise chatbot is to copy the provided widget script and paste it into your web page. Think of it like putting a sticker on a scrapbook page‚Äîjust find the right place, stick it on, and you‚Äôre done!

**How to Do It:**  
1. **Locate Your HTML File:**  
   This is the file that structures your web page. Open it so you can edit.
2. **Paste the Flowise Script:**  
   Put the chatbot script anywhere between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags in your HTML.  
   Here‚Äôs an example (replace the placeholders with your actual info):
   ```html
   <script type="module">
     import Chatbot from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowise-embed/dist/web.js';
     Chatbot.init({
       chatflowid: 'your-chatflowid-here',
       apiHost: 'your-apihost-here',
     })
   </script>
   ```
3. **Save and Refresh:**  
   Save your file and reload your website in your browser. Voil√†! The chatbot should appear.

## 2. Using a Specific Version‚ÄîStay Up to Date or Keep Things Stable

Just like apps on your phone, chatbot scripts have different versions. Sometimes, you need a specific version to ensure compatibility or stability.

**Why specify a version?**
- To match your Flowise platform version (important for features like streaming messages)
- If you want predictable behavior and fewer surprises

**How to Do It:**  
Replace `<some-version>` with your chosen version number:
```html
<script type="module">
  import Chatbot from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowise-embed@1.3.14/dist/web.js';
  Chatbot.init({
    chatflowid: 'your-chatflowid-here',
    apiHost: 'your-apihost-here',
  })
</script>
```
- See the [full list of versions here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flowise-embed?activeTab=versions).

**Important Note:**  
If your Flowise version is below v2.1.0, you should use the last maintained v1.x.x version ([v1.3.14](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flowise-embed?activeTab=versions)) for reliable streaming.

## 3. Customize the Chatbot‚ÄîMake it Look and Feel Unique

You can tweak colors, buttons, icons, welcome messages, and much more so your chatbot matches your brand or personality.

**Think of it as decorating a room‚Äîyou choose the colors, furniture, and lighting!**

**Sample Customization:**
```html
Chatbot.init({
  chatflowid: 'your-chatflowid-here',
  apiHost: 'your-apihost-here',
  theme: {
    button: {
      backgroundColor: '#3B81F6',
      size: 48,
      dragAndDrop: true,
      iconColor: 'white',
      autoWindowOpen: {
        autoOpen: true,
        openDelay: 2,
      },
    },
    tooltip: {
      showTooltip: true,
      tooltipMessage: 'Hi There üëã!',
      tooltipBackgroundColor: 'black',
      tooltipTextColor: 'white',
    },
    // ...more settings!
  },
})
```

See the **full list of customization options** in the [official documentation](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/FlowiseChatEmbed#configuration).

**Want even more control?**  
Starting from version v2.0.8, you can add custom CSS directly:
```html
theme: {
  customCSS: `
    /* Add your CSS styles here! */
    /* Use !important to override defaults */
  `,
}
```

## 4. Advanced Features: Observer & Config Options

If you want your chatbot to interact with your webpage or ‚Äúlisten‚Äù for certain signals (like user input changes or chatbot message events), you can use the **observersConfig** property.

**Example:**  
```html
observersConfig: {
  observeUserInput: (userInput) => {
    console.log({ userInput });
  },
  observeMessages: (messages) => {
    console.log({ messages });
  },
  observeLoading: (loading) => {
    console.log({ loading });
  },
}
```
This lets you run custom code whenever something happens inside the chatbot. It‚Äôs like placing security cameras inside your chatbot for extra insight!

## 5. Troubleshooting‚ÄîThe CORS Issue

Sometimes you might face an error message about ‚ÄúCORS policy.‚Äù This just means your website is checking if scripts from other places are allowed. Luckily, it‚Äôs easy to fix.

**Quick Fix:**  
Add the following environment variables:
```
CORS_ORIGINS=*
IFRAME_ORIGINS=*
```
**Depending on how you run Flowise:**
- For `npx flowise start` add flags:  
  `npx flowise start --CORS_ORIGINS=* --IFRAME_ORIGINS=*`
- For Docker/local clone:  
  Place the variables inside `.env` files ([details here](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/FlowiseDocs/blob/main/en/using-flowise/broken-reference/README.md))
