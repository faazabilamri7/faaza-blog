## Introduction

Imagine you're a pilot. You wouldn't just hop in a plane and take off without checking systems, would you? You'd run through a pre-flight checklist, test instruments, verify fuel levels‚Äîall to ensure a safe journey.

**Terraform infrastructure is no different.**

In our previous articles, we've learned to write Terraform code. But professional DevOps isn't just about writing code‚Äîit's about ensuring that code is **reliable, tested, and safely deployed** through automated processes.

Manual deployments are risky:

- "It works on my machine" doesn't guarantee it works in production
- Human error during deployments causes outages
- No audit trail of who deployed what
- Inconsistent processes lead to unpredictable results

**This article transforms you from a Terraform user into a professional DevOps engineer** who implements industry-standard practices for testing and automation.

**What you'll learn:**

- Why testing infrastructure code matters
- Different types of Terraform tests
- How to validate and lint Terraform code
- Testing strategies (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Automated deployment workflows
- Pull request automation
- Best practices for production deployments

Let's build professional-grade Terraform workflows!

## Why Test Infrastructure Code?

### The Cost of Infrastructure Failures

**Real-world scenario:**

You're deploying a database change to production. You run `terraform apply`, it looks good, you approve it. Suddenly:

- The database connection string format changed
- Your application can't connect
- Production is down
- Revenue loss: $10,000 per minute
- Time to fix: 2 hours
- **Total cost: $1.2 million**

**If only you had tested first.**

### What Can Go Wrong?

**1. Syntax Errors**

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami = "ami-12345"
  instance_type = t2.micro  # Missing quotes!
}
```

**2. Configuration Errors**

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345"
  instance_type = "t2.mega"  # This instance type doesn't exist!
}
```

**3. Logic Errors**

```hcl
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "ssh" {
  cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Exposes SSH to the entire internet!
}
```

**4. Breaking Changes**

```hcl
# This change will destroy and recreate the database!
# All data will be lost!
resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
  identifier = "new-identifier"  # Changed identifier
}
```

### Benefits of Testing

‚úÖ **Catch errors early** - Before they reach production

‚úÖ **Confidence in changes** - Know your code works

‚úÖ **Faster feedback** - Find issues in seconds, not hours

‚úÖ **Better collaboration** - Teammates trust tested code

‚úÖ **Audit trail** - Track what was tested and when

‚úÖ **Prevent outages** - Stop breaking changes before deployment

## The Testing Pyramid for Infrastructure

Just like application code, infrastructure testing has layers:

```
        /\
       /  \
      /E2E \        End-to-End Tests (Few, Slow, Expensive)
     /------\
    /        \
   /Integration\   Integration Tests (Some, Medium Speed)
  /------------\
 /              \
/   Unit Tests   \  Unit Tests (Many, Fast, Cheap)
------------------
```

### Level 1: Static Analysis (Unit Tests)

**What:** Analyze code without deploying anything

**Tools:**

- `terraform fmt` - Check formatting
- `terraform validate` - Check syntax
- `tflint` - Linting tool
- `checkov` - Security scanning
- `terraform-compliance` - Policy testing

**Speed:** ‚ö° Seconds

**Cost:** üí∞ Free

### Level 2: Plan Testing (Integration Tests)

**What:** Run `terraform plan` and verify expected changes

**Tools:**

- `terraform plan`
- Custom scripts to parse plan output

**Speed:** ‚ö°‚ö° Minutes

**Cost:** üí∞ Free

### Level 3: Deploy Testing (End-to-End Tests)

**What:** Actually deploy to a test environment and verify

**Tools:**

- `terraform apply` in test environment
- Terratest (Go testing framework)
- Kitchen-Terraform
- Custom validation scripts

**Speed:** üêå Minutes to hours

**Cost:** üí∞üí∞üí∞ Cloud resources required

## Static Analysis: Your First Line of Defense

Let's start with the fastest, cheapest tests!

### 1. Terraform Format (`terraform fmt`)

Ensures consistent code formatting.

**Run it:**

```bash
terraform fmt
```

**This auto-formats your code:**

Before:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web"{
ami="ami-12345"
  instance_type  =   "t2.micro"
}
```

After:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

**Check mode (for CI):**

```bash
terraform fmt -check -recursive
```

Returns non-zero exit code if files aren't formatted (fails CI build).

**Best practice:** Run in CI to enforce consistent style.

### 2. Terraform Validate (`terraform validate`)

Checks syntax and internal consistency.

**What it catches:**

- Syntax errors
- Invalid attribute names
- Type mismatches
- Invalid references

**Run it:**

```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
```

**Example errors:**

‚ùå Invalid attribute:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  invalid_attr  = "oops"
}
```

```
Error: Unsupported argument

  on main.tf line 4, in resource "aws_instance" "web":
   4:   invalid_attr  = "oops"

An argument named "invalid_attr" is not expected here.
```

‚ùå Invalid reference:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  subnet_id = aws_subnet.nonexistent.id
}
```

```
Error: Reference to undeclared resource

  on main.tf line 3:
   3:   subnet_id = aws_subnet.nonexistent.id

A managed resource "aws_subnet" "nonexistent" has not been declared.
```

**Best practice:** Always run in CI before plan/apply.

### 3. TFLint (Advanced Linting)

TFLint catches issues Terraform doesn't.

**Install:**

```bash
# macOS
brew install tflint

# Linux
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terraform-linters/tflint/master/install_linux.sh | bash

# Windows
choco install tflint
```

**Configure (`.tflint.hcl`):**

```hcl
plugin "aws" {
  enabled = true
  version = "0.21.0"
  source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-aws"
}

rule "terraform_unused_declarations" {
  enabled = true
}

rule "terraform_deprecated_syntax" {
  enabled = true
}

rule "aws_instance_invalid_type" {
  enabled = true
}
```

**Run it:**

```bash
tflint --init
tflint
```

**What it catches:**

‚ùå Invalid instance types:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  instance_type = "t2.mega"  # Doesn't exist!
}
```

```
Error: "t2.mega" is an invalid value as instance_type
```

‚ùå Deprecated syntax:

```hcl
variable "name" {
  type = "string"  # Old syntax
}
```

```
Warning: terraform_deprecated_syntax
variable type constraints should be specified with primitive type keywords
```

### 4. Checkov (Security Scanning)

Scans for security issues and compliance violations.

**Install:**

```bash
pip install checkov
```

**Run it:**

```bash
checkov -d .
```

**What it catches:**

‚ùå Unencrypted S3 bucket:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "data" {
  bucket = "my-data"
  # Missing encryption!
}
```

```
Check: CKV_AWS_19: "Ensure all data stored in S3 is encrypted"
FAILED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.data
```

‚ùå Security group open to world:

```hcl
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "ssh" {
  type        = "ingress"
  from_port   = 22
  to_port     = 22
  protocol    = "tcp"
  cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # SSH open to internet!
}
```

```
Check: CKV_AWS_24: "Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22"
FAILED
```

**Fix it:**

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "data" {
  bucket = "my-data"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "data" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.data.id

  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm = "AES256"
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Pre-Commit Hooks

Run tests automatically before every commit!

**Install pre-commit:**

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

**Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:**

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform
    rev: v1.77.1
    hooks:
      - id: terraform_fmt
      - id: terraform_validate
      - id: terraform_tflint
      - id: terraform_checkov
```

**Install hooks:**

```bash
pre-commit install
```

**Now every commit automatically runs:**

- terraform fmt
- terraform validate
- tflint
- checkov

**Try to commit bad code:**

```bash
git add main.tf
git commit -m "Add instance"
```

```
terraform_fmt........................................................Failed
terraform_validate...................................................Passed
terraform_tflint.....................................................Failed
terraform_checkov....................................................Failed

Commit blocked!
```

You must fix issues before committing!

## Plan Testing: Verify Expected Changes

Static analysis catches syntax errors, but what about logic errors?

**Plan testing verifies:**

- Resources being created/modified/destroyed
- Number of changes
- Specific attribute values

### Basic Plan Review

```bash
terraform plan -out=plan.tfplan
```

**Manual review:**
Look for unexpected:

- Resource deletions
- Recreations (delete + create)
- Sensitive data changes

### Automated Plan Checks

**Example script (`check_plan.sh`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Run plan and save output
terraform plan -out=plan.tfplan > plan_output.txt

# Check for resource deletions
if grep -q "# .* will be destroyed" plan_output.txt; then
  echo "ERROR: Plan includes resource deletions!"
  exit 1
fi

# Check number of changes
changes=$(grep -c "# .* will be created" plan_output.txt)
if [ $changes -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "WARNING: Creating more than 10 resources ($changes)"
  exit 1
fi

echo "Plan looks good!"
```

**Use in CI to prevent accidents!**

### Terraform Plan JSON Output

```bash
terraform plan -out=plan.tfplan
terraform show -json plan.tfplan > plan.json
```

**Parse with jq:**

```bash
# Count resources to be created
jq '[.resource_changes[] | select(.change.actions == ["create"])] | length' plan.json

# List resources to be destroyed
jq -r '.resource_changes[] | select(.change.actions == ["delete"]) | .address' plan.json

# Check for specific changes
jq '.resource_changes[] | select(.address == "aws_instance.web") | .change.after.instance_type' plan.json
```

**Write validation scripts!**

---

## End-to-End Testing: Deploy and Verify

The most thorough (and expensive) testing: actually deploy!

### Terratest (Go Testing Framework)

**Terratest** is the industry standard for E2E infrastructure testing.

**Install Go:**

```bash
# macOS
brew install go

# Linux
sudo snap install go --classic
```

**Create test file (`test/terraform_aws_test.go`):**

```go
package test

import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestTerraformAwsInstance(t *testing.T) {
    // Configure Terraform options
    terraformOptions := &terraform.Options{
        TerraformDir: "../examples/basic",

        Vars: map[string]interface{}{
            "instance_type": "t2.micro",
            "environment":   "test",
        },
    }

    // Clean up resources after test
    defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)

    // Deploy infrastructure
    terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)

    // Validate outputs
    instanceID := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "instance_id")
    assert.NotEmpty(t, instanceID)

    publicIP := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "public_ip")
    assert.NotEmpty(t, publicIP)
}
```

**Run test:**

```bash
cd test
go mod init test
go mod tidy
go test -v -timeout 30m
```

**What this does:**

1. Runs `terraform init` and `terraform apply`
2. Verifies outputs are not empty
3. Runs `terraform destroy` to clean up
4. Reports pass/fail

**More advanced test:**

```go
func TestWebServerIsAccessible(t *testing.T) {
    terraformOptions := &terraform.Options{
        TerraformDir: "../examples/web-server",
    }

    defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)
    terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)

    // Get public IP
    publicIP := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "public_ip")
    url := fmt.Sprintf("http://%s", publicIP)

    // Test HTTP connectivity
    http_helper.HttpGetWithRetry(
        t,
        url,
        nil,
        200,
        "Hello World",
        30,
        5*time.Second,
    )
}
```

This actually:

1. Deploys infrastructure
2. Gets the web server IP
3. Makes HTTP requests to verify it's working
4. Cleans up

### Simple Shell Script Testing

Don't want to learn Go? Use shell scripts!

**test.sh:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Deploying test environment..."
cd test-environment
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

echo "Running validation..."

# Get outputs
INSTANCE_ID=$(terraform output -raw instance_id)
PUBLIC_IP=$(terraform output -raw public_ip)

# Verify instance exists
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids $INSTANCE_ID

# Test web server
response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://$PUBLIC_IP)
if [ $response -eq 200 ]; then
  echo "‚úì Web server is accessible"
else
  echo "‚úó Web server returned $response"
  exit 1
fi

echo "Cleaning up..."
terraform destroy -auto-approve

echo "‚úì All tests passed!"
```

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions: Automation at Scale

Now let's automate everything with GitHub Actions!

### Basic Workflow: Validate on Every Push

**.github/workflows/terraform.yml:**

```yaml
name: Terraform CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  terraform:
    name: Terraform Validation
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
        with:
          terraform_version: 1.5.0

      - name: Terraform Format Check
        run: terraform fmt -check -recursive

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Validate
        run: terraform validate

      - name: TFLint
        uses: terraform-linters/setup-tflint@v3
        with:
          tflint_version: latest

      - name: Run TFLint
        run: |
          tflint --init
          tflint
```

**What this does:**

- Runs on every push and pull request
- Checks formatting
- Validates syntax
- Runs TFLint

**Status badge in README:**

```markdown
![Terraform CI](https://github.com/username/repo/workflows/Terraform%20CI/badge.svg)
```

### Advanced Workflow: Plan on PR, Apply on Merge

**.github/workflows/terraform-plan.yml:**

```yaml
name: Terraform Plan

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  plan:
    name: Terraform Plan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout

          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Plan
        id: plan
        run: |
          terraform plan -no-color -out=plan.tfplan
          terraform show -no-color plan.tfplan > plan.txt

      - name: Comment PR with Plan
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            const fs = require('fs');
            const plan = fs.readFileSync('plan.txt', 'utf8');
            const output = `#### Terraform Plan üìñ

            <details><summary>Show Plan</summary>

            \`\`\`
            ${plan}
            \`\`\`

            </details>

            *Pusher: @${{ github.actor }}, Action: \`${{ github.event_name }}\`*`;

            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: output
            });
```

**.github/workflows/terraform-apply.yml:**

```yaml
name: Terraform Apply

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  apply:
    name: Terraform Apply
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production # Requires manual approval

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2

      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Apply
        run: terraform apply -auto-approve
```

**Workflow:**

1. Developer creates PR
2. GitHub Actions runs `terraform plan`
3. Plan is commented on PR
4. Team reviews plan
5. PR is merged to main
6. Manual approval required (GitHub Environments)
7. `terraform apply` runs automatically

### Multi-Environment Workflow

**.github/workflows/deploy.yml:**

```yaml
name: Deploy to Environments

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Environment to deploy'
        required: true
        type: choice
        options:
          - dev
          - staging
          - production

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}

    steps:

## Professional Developer Workflows

### Workflow 1: GitFlow with Terraform

```
main (production)
  ‚Üë
  merge after approval
  ‚Üë
staging (testing)
  ‚Üë
  merge after CI passes
  ‚Üë
feature/new-vpc (development)
```

**Process:**

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes
3. Push ‚Üí CI runs validation
4. Create PR ‚Üí Plan runs, comments on PR
5. Merge to `staging` ‚Üí Auto-deploy to staging
6. Test in staging
7. Create PR to `main` ‚Üí Manual approval required
8. Merge to `main` ‚Üí Deploy to production

### Workflow 2: Trunk-Based Development

```
main (all environments)
  ‚Üë
  merge frequently (multiple times per day)
  ‚Üë
short-lived feature branches
```

**Process:**

1. Create small feature branch
2. Make minimal changes
3. PR ‚Üí Plan runs
4. Quick review & merge
5. Deploy to dev automatically
6. Manual trigger for staging/production

### Workflow 3: Environment Branches

```
production branch ‚Üí production environment
staging branch ‚Üí staging environment
dev branch ‚Üí dev environment
```

**Process:**

1. Work in `dev` branch
2. Push ‚Üí Auto-deploy to dev
3. Merge to `staging` ‚Üí Auto-deploy to staging
4. Merge to `production` ‚Üí Manual approval ‚Üí Deploy to production

## Best Practices for Production Deployments

### 1. Always Require Code Review

**GitHub branch protection:**

- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks (CI must pass)
- No direct pushes to main

### 2. Use Remote State with Locking

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-state"
    key            = "production/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

Prevents concurrent modifications!

### 3. Separate State Per Environment

```
s3://terraform-state/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev/terraform.tfstate
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging/terraform.tfstate
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ production/terraform.tfstate
```

Changes in dev don't affect production!

### 4. Use Terraform Workspaces (Alternative)

```bash
# Create workspaces
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace new production

# Switch between them
terraform workspace select production
terraform apply
```

**State files:**

```
terraform.tfstate.d/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.tfstate
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.tfstate
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ production/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.tfstate
```

### 5. Implement Approval Gates

**GitHub Environments with required reviewers:**

```yaml
environment: production
```

**In GitHub settings:**

- Create "production" environment
- Add required reviewers
- Apply will wait for approval!

### 6. Enable Detailed Logging

```yaml
- name: Terraform Apply
  run: terraform apply -auto-approve
  env:
    TF_LOG: INFO
```

Helps debug issues!

### 7. Use Drift Detection

**Scheduled workflow to detect manual changes:**

```yaml
name: Drift Detection

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Daily at midnight

jobs:
  drift:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2

      - name: Check for Drift
        run: |
          terraform init
          terraform plan -detailed-exitcode
        # Exit code 2 means changes detected (drift)
```

Alerts you if someone changed infrastructure outside Terraform!

### 8. Tag Releases

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0: Added new VPC"
git push origin v1.2.0
```

Know exactly what version is deployed!

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Never Commit Secrets

‚ùå Bad:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
  secret_key = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
}
```

‚úÖ Good:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  # Uses AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY env vars
}
```

**In GitHub Actions:**

```yaml
env:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

### 2. Scan for Secrets

**Use git-secrets:**

```bash
git secrets --install
git secrets --register-aws
```

Prevents committing AWS keys!

### 3. Encrypt State Files

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket  = "terraform-state"
    encrypt = true  # Enable encryption!
  }
}
```

### 4. Limit AWS Permissions

Create least-privilege IAM policy for Terraform:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["ec2:Describe*", "ec2:CreateVpc", "ec2:CreateSubnet"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Only what Terraform needs!

---

## Cost Management

### 1. Auto-Destroy Test Environments

```yaml
- name: Cleanup
  if: always()
  run: terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

Don't leave test resources running!

### 2. Use Terraform Cloud Cost Estimation

Shows estimated monthly cost before applying!

### 3. Tag Resources for Cost Tracking

```hcl
tags = {
  Environment = var.environment
  CostCenter  = "Engineering"
  Project     = "WebApp"
  ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
}
```

Track costs per environment/project in AWS Cost Explorer!

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: State Lock Errors

```
Error: Error acquiring the state lock
Lock Info:
  ID:        abc123
  Operation: OperationTypeApply
  Who:       user@hostname
  Created:   2023-10-09 10:30:00
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# If you're SURE no one else is running terraform:
terraform force-unlock abc123
```

### Issue 2: Provider Version Conflicts

```
Error: Failed to query available provider packages
```

**Solution:**

```bash
rm -rf .terraform
terraform init -upgrade
```

### Issue 3: GitHub Actions Timeout

Default timeout is 360 minutes, but you can set custom:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    timeout-minutes: 60
```
