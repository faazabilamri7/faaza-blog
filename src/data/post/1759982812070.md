A Beginner’s Guide to Evaluations: Testing the Performance of Your Chatflow or Agentflow

---

**Introduction**

Ever wondered how you can make sure your Chatflow or Agentflow is working as intended? Whether you’re building a chatbot for customer service or an AI assistant for your business, evaluations are essential for understanding how well your application responds to users.  
In this guide, we’ll break down the basics of evaluations—what they are, why they matter, and how you can use them to monitor and improve your Chatflow or Agentflow’s performance. By the end, you’ll know how to run and understand evaluations with confidence, even if you’re new to these concepts.

**Section 1: What Are Evaluations?**

Let’s imagine your Chatflow is like a student taking a test:  
- The student (Chatflow/Agentflow) receives questions (inputs) and submits answers (outputs).
- Evaluations are the process of `grading` the answers to see how well the student performed.

In technical terms, evaluations take a set of inputs, check the outputs your Chatflow generates, and give them scores. These scores help you figure out if your Chatflow is answering correctly, responding quickly, and generally doing its job well.

*Evaluations are available on Cloud and Enterprise plans. [See source](https://docs.flowiseai.com/evaluations) for the official documentation.*

**Section 2: Using Datasets—Building Your "Test Paper"**

The **dataset** is like the set of questions and correct answers in the test analogy:
- **Inputs**: The questions you want your Chatflow to answer, such as “What is the capital of UK?”
- **Outputs**: The expected correct answers, like “Capital of UK is London”.

You can add these manually or upload a CSV file with two columns: one for input, one for output. This makes it easy to create your own mini-exam to see how your Chatflow handles different scenarios.

**Example Dataset:**

| Input                             | Output                       |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| What is the capital of UK         | Capital of UK is London      |
| How many days are there in a year | There are 365 days in a year |

**Section 3: Evaluators—How Are Answers Graded?**

Evaluators are the "teachers" that grade the test. There are three main types:

**1. Text-Based Evaluators:**
These check if the Chatflow’s response contains certain words or patterns.  
- Examples:  
   - Contains Any  
   - Starts With  
   - Does Not Contain All

Think of this as checking if your answer includes the right keywords.

**2. Numeric-Based Evaluators:**
These look at numbers, like how many words (tokens) were used, or how fast a response is given (latency).
- Examples:
   - Total Tokens (word count)
   - API Latency (response speed)
   - Output Character Length (answer length)

Imagine checking how long the student took to answer or how many sentences they wrote.

**3. LLM-Based Evaluators:**
Here, another AI (Large Language Model, or LLM) acts like an expert judge, deciding if your Chatflow's answer is correct or if it contains made-up (hallucinated) information.

- Examples:
  - Hallucination
  - Correctness

It’s like asking an expert to review the answer for quality and accuracy.

**Section 4: Running an Evaluation—Step-by-Step**

**Here’s how you evaluate your chatflows:**

1. **Select Dataset & Chatflow:**  
   Choose which set of questions and which chatflows you want to test.

2. **Choose Evaluators:**  
   Pick how you want your answers to be checked (text or numeric evaluators).

3. **(Optional) Add LLM Evaluator:**  
   For a deeper review, you can let an AI judge assess the answers.

4. **Start Evaluation:**  
   Let the process run. Your Chatflow answers each input, and the evaluators grade what comes out.

5. **Review Results:**  
   After it’s done, you’ll see charts showing the pass/fail rate, response speed, and more.  
   Detailed tables list each test case so you can see exactly how your Chatflow performed.

**Example Summary Finds:**
- Pass/fail rate (how many answers were correct)
- Average response time
- Number of tokens used per answer

This helps you spot problem areas, like slow responses or wrong answers.

**Section 5: Re-running and Comparing Evaluations**

Sometimes you update your Chatflow to fix mistakes or make improvements. When you do, you can re-run the same evaluation:
- The tool will show you a warning when flows have changed.
- You can compare the latest results with previous versions to see if things improved.

It’s a bit like giving your student a retest after extra tutoring—did they get better?

**Conclusion: Key Takeaways**

Evaluations are a powerful and simple way to check if your Chatflow or Agentflow is doing its job right. By setting up datasets, choosing evaluators, and analyzing results, even beginners can spot issues and improve their flows.

Remember:
- **Datasets** = the questions and correct answers
- **Evaluators** = the way you grade your Chatflow’s outputs
- **Evaluation results** = your score sheet, highlighting what’s working and what’s not

Regular evaluations keep your chatbot performance sharp and reliable!

**FAQ**

**Q1: Can I run evaluations if I’m on a free plan?**  
A: No—evaluations are only available for Cloud and Enterprise users. [Learn more](https://docs.flowiseai.com/evaluations).

**Q2: Do I need coding skills to use evaluations?**  
A: Not really! Creating datasets and running evaluations can be done through simple uploads and selections—no coding required.

**Q3: What does a high API latency mean?**  
A: It means your Chatflow took a longer time to respond. Faster is usually better, so high latency can signal a need for optimization.
