## Introduction: Why Upsertion Matters in AI Workflows

Have you ever wondered how advanced AI systems can search and answer questions using data from huge collections of PDFs, Word files, or spreadsheets? The secret lies in a process called **upsertion**, which is the backbone of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

In basic terms, upsertion is about uploading and organizing your documents in a way that AI can understand and use. Whether you’re a developer, a data enthusiast, or just curious about modern AI, knowing how upsertion works unlocks the door to smarter searches and better AI-powered answers.

In this article, we’ll explain upsertion step by step, show you practical examples, and answer the most common beginner questions. By the end, you'll know the basics of feeding your data into AI models and how to get started with tools like [FlowiseAI’s Document Stores](https://docs.flowiseai.com/using-flowise/document-stores).

## 1. What Is Upsertion and Why Should You Care?

**Upsertion = Upload + Insert + Process**

Imagine you have a filing cabinet full of paper documents. Upsertion is like taking all those papers, scanning them, sorting them, and putting them in a digital drawer where your AI assistant can quickly find what you need.

**Why is this important?**
- **Enables powerful search:** AI can scan and retrieve facts from your documents much faster.
- **Updates your knowledge base:** New uploads replace or add to old info, keeping your system fresh.
- **Foundation for chatbots & RAG systems:** These systems rely on organized data to answer your questions.

**Two main methods for upserting into vector stores:**
- **Document Stores (Recommended):** A unified interface for managing and retrieving data.
- **Chatflow Upsert:** An older method with basic capabilities.

## 2. Understanding the Upsert Workflow

A successful upsert process involves moving your data through several important steps (called **nodes**):

**Here’s the basic flow:**
1. **Document Loader**: Fetches your file (like a PDF or CSV).
2. **Text Splitter**: Breaks your document into manageable chunks.
3. **Embedding Model**: Converts text chunks into “vectors”—number sequences that AI can work with.
4. **Vector Store**: Stores those chunks for fast searching.
5. **Record Manager** (optional): Keeps track of updates or deletions.

This workflow ensures that your documents are ready for lightning-fast retrieval and AI analysis.

**Visual Example:**

## 3. How to Perform Upsertion: Easy Methods & Examples

### A. Manual Upsertion in Flowise

Once you’ve built your upserting flow, just hit the **green button** at the top right of the interface to start upserting.

![Manual Upsert Button](https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2FIRrVLBNnHt08WCYnCp2Z%2FPicture1.png?alt=media&token=ef8d347f-57fe-4459-9684-d5054cf1aa2b)

### B. Upserting Using the API: Step-by-Step

#### 1. **Uploading Files (Form Data Method)**
If you want to upload a file (such as a PDF, DOCX, or Excel), you use the API endpoint:

```
POST /api/v1/vector/upsert/:id
```
(base URL is usually `http://localhost:3000` or your server address)

**Supported file types:**  
- CSV (`.csv`)
- Word (`.docx`)
- PDF (`.pdf`)
- Text (`.txt`)
- Excel (`.xlsx`)
- Powerpoint (`.pptx`)
- And more (see [official docs](https://docs.flowiseai.com/api-reference/vector-upsert))

**Quick Example (Python):**
```python
import requests
url = "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/vector/upsert/your-chatflow-id"
files = {'files': open('documents/knowledge_base.pdf', 'rb')}
data = {'overrideConfig': '{"chunkSize":1000,"chunkOverlap":200}'}
response = requests.post(url, files=files, data=data)
print(response.json())
```
See more code examples in this [API Reference](https://docs.flowiseai.com/api-reference/vector-upsert).

#### 2. **Uploading Without Files (JSON Method)**
If your data comes from web scraping or a database, use a JSON POST request:

**Example (Python):**
```python
import requests
url = "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/vector/upsert/chatflow-id"
payload = {"overrideConfig": {"chunkSize": 800, "chunkOverlap": 100}}
response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
print(response.json())
```

**Authentication Tip:**  
For secured setups, include your API key as described [here](https://docs.flowiseai.com/configuration/authorization/chatflow-level).

### C. Optimizing Your Upsert Process

**For best results:**
- **Batch upload files:** Group smaller files and upload together to save time.
- **Attach metadata:** Add tags (like department, category, upload date) for better searching.
- **Customize chunk size:** Larger chunks mean fewer entries, but smaller ones are easier to search.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- If uploads fail, check file size/format.
- If the process times out, try smaller chunks or split big files.
- Check your vector store and model configuration if errors occur.

## 4. What Happens When You Upsert? Understanding the API Response

After a successful upsert, you'll see a breakdown of what happened:

- **numAdded:** Chunks added to the database
- **numDeleted:** Old chunks cleared out (if updating)
- **numSkipped:** Parts of files skipped (e.g., duplicates)
- **numUpdated:** Chunks that replaced older versions

Knowing these stats helps you track how efficiently your knowledge base is growing.

## FAQ: Your Upsertion Questions Answered

**Q1: Do I need programming skills to upsert documents?**  
Not necessarily. You can start with manual uploads in Flowise’s interface. For automation, basic scripting helps, but sample code is provided for most common workflows.

**Q2: Can I update or delete old documents?**  
Yes, using the Record Manager node or API, you can manage updates and deletions to keep your knowledge base fresh.

**Q3: What’s the best file type to use?**  
PDFs are widely supported; however, using the “File Loader” node allows for mixed file types in one go. Always check compatibility in the [official doc](https://docs.flowiseai.com/using-flowise/document-stores).
