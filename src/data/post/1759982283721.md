**Streaming AI Responses: How Flowise Makes Real-Time Predictions Easy**

## Introduction: Why Streaming Responses Matter in AI

Ever chatted with an AI and watched it "type" answers, word by word? That’s streaming in action! Streaming isn’t just visual flair—it’s a powerful technique that delivers information as soon as it’s available, making interactions faster and more engaging. Whether you’re building chatbots, smart apps, or research tools, understanding streaming can supercharge your AI projects.

In this article, you’ll learn what AI streaming is, why it’s useful, and how Flowise lets you easily use streaming in Python, TypeScript, or even from the command line. We’ll break down each step so that you can get started, even if you’re a beginner!

## What Is Streaming in AI Predictions?

**Streaming** is like getting real-time updates instead of waiting for everything at once. Think of it as someone reading a story to you one word at a time, instead of handing you the whole book at the end.

### How Streaming Works:

- **Normal Prediction:** Request is sent → Entire answer is built → Response is sent back.
- **Streaming Prediction:** Request is sent → Each word or sentence (called a "token") is sent to you immediately as it’s generated.

This is done using **server-sent events (SSE)**—a web technology where the server keeps sending data as it’s ready. Curious about SSE? Check out [MDN’s guide to server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format).

**Why does this matter?**
- Faster feedback for users
- Smoother experiences in chatbots and interactive AI tools
- Less waiting around for results

## Using Flowise for Streaming Predictions (with Python & TypeScript)

Flowise makes AI streaming practical for everyone, whether you code in Python, TypeScript, or just use cURL. Here’s how you can try it out:

### 1. Python: Easy Streaming Example

Flowise’s Python library lets you set up streaming in just a few lines.  
Download it first from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/flowise/) using `pip install flowise`.

```python
from flowise import Flowise, PredictionData

def test_streaming():
    client = Flowise()
    completion = client.create_prediction(
        PredictionData(
            chatflowId="<flow-id>",
            question="Tell me a joke!",
            streaming=True
        )
    )
    print("Streaming response:")
    for chunk in completion:
        print(chunk)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_streaming()
```

**What's happening here?**
- You ask a question (“Tell me a joke!”)
- Each part of the answer comes as soon as it’s ready
- Output comes as chunks (tokens) you can print or process

### 2. TypeScript: Streaming in Web Apps

Flowise also supports TypeScript via its SDK ([Download here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flowise-sdk)).

```javascript
import { FlowiseClient } from 'flowise-sdk'

async function test_streaming() {
  const client = new FlowiseClient({ baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000' });

  const prediction = await client.createPrediction({
    chatflowId: '<flow-id>',
    question: 'What is the capital of France?',
    streaming: true,
  });

  for await (const chunk of prediction) {
      console.log(chunk);
  }
}

test_streaming()
```

**This is perfect for web apps, chatbots, and dashboards.**

### 3. cURL: Streaming with Command Line Tools

No coding required! Just use the command line:
```bash
curl https://localhost:3000/api/v1/predictions/{flow-id} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Hello world!",
    "streaming": true
  }'
```
**Tip:** You’ll see each new part of the answer as it streams in your terminal!

## What Do the Different Streaming Events Mean?

Flowise streams data using special event labels.  
Here’s a quick rundown:

| **Event**        | **What It Means**                                                                               |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| start            | Streaming has begun                                                                            |
| token            | A new piece of the answer (like a word or phrase) has arrived                                  |
| error            | Something went wrong with prediction                                                           |
| end              | The answer is finished                                                                         |
| metadata         | Extra info about the chat or message (like IDs), sent after all tokens, before 'end' event     |
| sourceDocuments  | Tells you where the AI found its info (if used a vector database)                              |
| usedTools        | Lists which tools the AI used to answer                                                        |

You can see more about how these events work in the [Server-Sent Events documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format).

## FAQ: Streaming with Flowise — Common Beginner Questions

**1. Do I need advanced programming skills to use Flowise streaming?**  
No! The Python and TypeScript examples above require only basic coding knowledge, and the cURL method needs no programming at all.

**2. Will streaming work for any type of AI question?**  
Streaming is best when the response is generated word-by-word or piece-by-piece (like in chatbots). It might not apply to every AI model but works well for conversational ones.

**3. How do I know when the response is finished?**  
Look for the `end` event—it’s sent after all tokens (chunks) have streamed.
