**Step 2: Engaging Introduction**

Have you wondered how apps like Siri can understand your speech, or how translation services transform whole paragraphs of text instantly? The magic behind these feats lies in a set of deep learning techniques called *sequence modeling*. In this post, we’ll unravel the basics behind key sequence modeling tools: **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, **Transformers**, and the concept of **Attention**. You’ll learn how these models make sense of sequences – like text, music, and even weather – and discover why they power today’s most advanced artificial intelligence (AI). If you’re new to these ideas, don't worry! This post explains everything in plain, easy-to-understand language.

**Step 3: Core Concepts Broken Down**

### 1. What is Sequence Modeling?

Think of sequence modeling like predicting the next move in a game. Instead of looking at just one moment, you use *history* to make better, smarter guesses. This is important for tasks where context matters – like understanding a sentence, generating music, or tracking a moving object.

**Real-life examples of sequences:**
- Words in a sentence (for language models)
- Musical notes (for composing music)
- Stock prices over time
- Heartbeats on an electrocardiogram (ECG)
- Frames in a video

When a computer "models" a sequence, it’s looking for patterns that happen over time, not just at one point.

### 2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Learning From the Past

A traditional neural network looks at one input at a time, like a snapshot. But what if you need to consider earlier events? That’s where **RNNs** come in.

**Analogy:**  
Imagine you're listening to a story – to predict what might happen next, you have to remember previous parts of the plot! RNNs do exactly this – they pass along a "memory" (called a hidden state) from one step to the next, updating it as they go.

**How RNNs work in practice:**
- Take an input (like a word or a musical note) at time T.
- Remember what happened previously – store this in the hidden state.
- Use both the new input AND this memory to decide what happens next.
- Repeat for each step in the sequence.

**Key points:**
- RNNs help computers learn patterns over time.
- They’re commonly used for things like text prediction or music generation.
- RNNs can struggle with very long sequences due to their limited “memory.”

### 3. How Do RNNs Learn? Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

RNNs learn by comparing their predictions to the real answers (using a *loss* function), then updating their internal weights to improve future predictions. But since they process sequences step by step, learning happens across all time steps – a process called **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**.

**Challenges:**
- If things go wrong, errors quickly become huge (*exploding gradients*) or vanish (*vanishing gradients*).
- This makes training RNNs for long sequences tricky.

To address this, researchers have invented improved versions—like **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks—which can "decide" what information to keep or forget over time.

### 4. Representing Words as Numbers: The Importance of Embeddings

Neural networks work with numbers, but language is built from words. So, how do we bridge this gap?

**Embeddings** are a way to turn words into lists of numbers, so the network can process them.  
- Simple approach: “one-hot encoding” (each word gets a unique list).
- Smarter approach: learn **word embeddings** that cluster similar words together (like “cat” and “dog” being close).

This is crucial for making language models work.

### 5. The Attention Mechanism: "Focusing" on What Matters

Suppose you’re reading a long sentence, and some words are more important than others. Wouldn’t it be useful if a computer could “focus” on the key words? That’s attention!

**How attention works:**
- Look over the whole input to find relationships (like which words matter most to predict the next word).
- Assign “attention weights” to each part – higher for important items, lower for others.

**Analogy:**  
When searching for a video on YouTube, you type a query (“cat videos”), and the search engine matches it to the most relevant results. In attention, each part of the input acts like a query looking for the best match.

### 6. Transformers: A New Way to Handle Sequences

Transformers take attention to the next level. Introduced in the landmark paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), they process sequences *all at once* (not step by step), making them much faster and better at capturing long-term patterns.

**Key innovations:**
- Data is fed into the model in parallel, so training is quick.
- Use *positional embeddings* to know where things are in the sequence.
- Stack multiple “attention heads” to learn different patterns at the same time.

**Why transformers are game changers:**
- They power modern AI models like ChatGPT and GPT-4.
- Used for tasks beyond language—vision transformers can process images!

**Step 4: Conclusion & Main Takeaways**

Sequence modeling is at the heart of today’s smartest AI. RNNs gave computers the power to learn from history, and attention-based models like Transformers made it possible to process huge amounts of data quickly and effectively. From predicting your next word to generating brand-new music, these models are revolutionizing technology—as you’ve learned from the MIT 6.S191 lecture.

**Step 5: FAQ**

**Q1: Why are RNNs hard to train for long sequences?**  
Because errors (gradients) can either explode or vanish as you go back through many steps, making learning unstable.

**Q2: What’s the difference between RNNs and Transformers?**  
RNNs look at sequences step by step, passing “memory” along. Transformers process all steps together using attention, making them faster and better at long-term dependencies.

**Q3: What does “attention” mean in AI?**  
It’s a way for the model to focus on the most important parts of the input, just like your brain zooms in on key words when reading.
