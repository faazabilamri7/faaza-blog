How to Learn Machine Learning in 2025 (Beginner-Friendly Guide Inspired by a Research Scientist)

---

**Introduction:**

Have you ever wondered how you’d start learning machine learning (ML) if you could begin all over again with today’s resources? Whether you’re a tech newbie, a curious student, or someone eager to make a career switch, the world of ML is more open and accessible than ever. In fact, all you need is a laptop—and the right set of steps!

Recently, a research scientist shared his personal roadmap for mastering machine learning in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xIwjmCH6D4). He’s spent over six years becoming an expert, but believes you can make faster progress with modern free tools and a focused approach. This blog breaks down his advice for absolute beginners, so you can start strong and avoid common pitfalls.

Let’s discover how you can learn ML in 2025—step by step!

---

### 1. **Start with Python, the Language of Machine Learning**

Imagine Python as the universal language spoken by all ML practitioners—like travelers sharing a common tongue. This is the most essential foundation you'll need.

**What Should You Learn?**
- Understand what **lists** and **dictionaries** are and how they differ (think of a *list* as a numbered shopping list, and a *dictionary* as a contacts book with names and phone numbers paired up).
- Learn **for loops** (making a computer repeat actions, like a bakery batch-making cookies).
- Practice **if-elif-else statements** (which are just decision-makers, like “if it’s sunny, go outside; else, stay in”).
- Explore **list comprehension** (a shortcut to create lists) and **class inheritance** (think: dogs and cats inheriting features from animals).
  
**Getting Started:**
Search “beginner Python tutorial” on YouTube or Google. There are loads of free, high-quality guides—[like these beginner resources](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=beginner+python+tutorial). Make sure you code along as you learn, not just watch!

---

### 2. **Build Fun Beginner Projects**

Practice is essential. Jump right in by creating something small and enjoyable!

**Examples:**
- **Calculator:** A simple app that does math for you.
- **Snake Game:** The classic retro snake game you control with your keyboard.
- **Simple Website:** Make a personal webpage about your favorite topic.

**Tip:** Don’t aim for perfection; the goal is learning by doing. If you already know some coding basics, don’t linger too long—move on when you feel comfortable.

---

### 3. **Don’t Fear the Math: Focus on What’s Really Needed**

ML isn’t reserved for math geniuses. Most essential concepts are undergraduate-level and practical.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Derivatives and Integrals:** Basic calculus for understanding how models learn and adjust.
- **Vectors & Matrices:** Ways to represent lots of data at once—like spreadsheets for math.
- **Probability Theory:** Figuring out chances, similar to rolling dice or predicting the weather.
- **Handy Math Tricks:** Logarithms, summation rules, etc.—these are tools you pick up as needed.

**Where to Learn:**
A recommended resource is the book “[Why Machines Learn](https://www.whymachineslearn.com/)” (practical, beginner-friendly explanations). For specific math concepts, try searching YouTube for quick tutorials. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is also great for brushing up basics.

**Remember:** If you get stuck, tools like language models (LMs) can help—just double-check answers for accuracy!

### 4. **Deep Dive into Machine Learning and Deep Learning Basics**

Now comes the fun part—actual ML and deep learning!

- **Classical Machine Learning:** Start with widely used methods like logistic regression and decision trees (think: making decisions based on facts, like sorting animals into groups based on features).
- **Deep Learning:** Learn about neural networks (computers mimicking how brains work) and popular architectures.

**Recommended Courses:**
- [Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) for foundational models.
- [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) for neural networks and practical exercises.
- For Transformers (the backbone of modern ML), check out [Stanford’s CS25 YouTube Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn).

### 5. **Choose Your Path: Applied ML or Researcher Track**

**Applied Path:**  
Want to get a job quickly? Focus on mastering practical coding and model deployment, not deep theory. Just finish the recommended courses and start applying models to real problems.

**Researcher Path:**  
Interested in cutting-edge theory and working at top companies? Dive deeper using “[Understanding Deep Learning](https://www.understandingdeeplearning.com/)” (free PDF available) and practice with theoretical and coding exercises.

> Whichever path you choose, mix in practical projects to reinforce learning.

### 6. **Learn by Doing: Build Real Projects**

Projects are *the* best way to learn ML. You get hands-on experience, build confidence, and create a portfolio for future jobs.

**How to Start:**
- Use libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** for manipulating and visualizing data (watch [quick tutorials here](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=python+numpy+pandas+matplotlib+tutorial)).
- Try simple machine learning frameworks: **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, or **JAX**.
- Participate in beginner-friendly [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- Advance by recreating research papers or building end-to-end ML products.

**Tip:** Your first project will likely be messy. This is normal! With every project, you’ll improve and be able to tackle bigger challenges.

---

### 7. **Show Your Work: Build Your Online Presence**

“Learning out loud” can open doors—share progress posts on X (Twitter), LinkedIn, or write blog articles explaining what you’ve learned. If you complete a project, create a demo or technical write-up. This helped the video’s speaker land interviews at Google DeepMind!

---

### 8. **Final Thoughts: Persistence Wins**

Learning ML is a journey, not a sprint. It takes time, effort, and lots of patience. You’ll struggle (everyone does!), but with fun projects and community sharing, you'll stay motivated.

**Remember:**  
- Progress is slow but steady.
- The best way to learn is to build, share, and reflect.
- Don’t give up—everyone starts somewhere!

## FAQ: (Beginner Questions)

**1. Do I need a powerful computer to learn ML?**  
No! For most beginner projects, a basic laptop is enough. Later, you can use free cloud resources (like Google Colab) for larger models.

**2. Is knowing advanced math required?**  
Not for most day-to-day ML. Focus on intuitive basics—derivatives, vectors, probability. For research, stronger math helps, but you’ll learn gradually.

**3. Can I learn ML without a CS or math degree?**  
Absolutely. Many successful ML engineers are self-taught. With dedication and the resources above, anyone can start!
