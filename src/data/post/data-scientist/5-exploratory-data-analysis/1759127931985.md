## Introduction

Have you ever wondered what data scientists actually do before they build machine learning models? The secret sauce often lies in something called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering. If you're new to these terms, don't worry! In this article, we'll walk through everythingâ€”from loading tricky datasets to transforming raw data into something valuable for machine learning. By the end, you'll learn how to approach real-world data problems just like the experts and get practical tips and code snippets you can use right away.

We'll be referencing techniques and hands-on demos covered in Krish Naik's thorough YouTube session, [Complete Exploratory Data Analysis And Feature Engineering In 3 Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHFOANOHwh8).

## What Is EDA and Feature Engineering?

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Imagine EDA as looking at a box of puzzle pieces before you start putting the puzzle together. You sort, count, and understand the pieces, making notes about missing ones or special shapes. In data science, EDA helps you:

- Understand what your data looks like (rows, columns, types, etc.)
- Spot missing values
- Find duplicates
- Identify unusual patterns

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is like reshaping puzzle pieces to make them fit better. In data science, it means:

- Creating new variables (features) that make patterns clearer for machine learning models
- Cleaning and converting data types (numbers, dates, categories)
- Encoding text or categorical info into numbers

**Analogy:** EDA is preparing your workspace, and Feature Engineering is creating custom tools to solve your puzzle.

## Loading Data & Checking for Common Issues

### 1. Import Data and Libraries

Getting started always requires loading useful Python libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
```

You then load your dataset, often using `pd.read_csv()` or `pd.read_excel()`.

### 2. Handling Errors While Importing

**Common Error:** `UnicodeDecodeError` â€“ happens when files have different encoding formats.

**Solution:** Try different encoding options such as `"utf-8"`, `"latin1"`, or others.

```python
df = pd.read_csv('zomato.csv', encoding='latin1')
```

### 3. Inspect Your Data

Check basic info:

- `.info()` shows types and missing values.
- `.describe()` gives stats for numeric columns.

---

## Identifying and Handling Missing Values

Missing values can mess up analysis or model training.

- **Find them:** `df.isnull().sum()`
- **Visualize:** Use heatmaps to spot gaps.

```python
sns.heatmap(df.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap="viridis")
```

- **Fill them:** For categorical columns, use the mode (most common value). For numeric, use mean, median, or another logical replacement.

### Practical Example

Suppose "Cuisines" has missing values:

```python
df['Cuisines'].fillna(df['Cuisines'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
```

---

## Combining Multiple Data Sources

Often, you have different files with related infoâ€”like `zomato.csv` and `countrycode.xlsx`.

- **Merge datasets:** Use `pd.merge()` to combine on a common column (e.g. `country code`).

```python
final_df = pd.merge(df, country_df, on='Country Code', how='left')
```

This way, you get extra features (like country name) added to every row.

---

## Understanding Categorical Variables

Numbers vs. Categories:

- **Numeric columns:** Used for calculations, e.g. price, latitude.
- **Categorical columns:** Used for grouping, e.g. country, city.

**Why does it matter?** Most machine learning algorithms need numbers, not text!

---

## Encoding Categorical Variables

### 1. Label Encoding
Convert text labels to numbers.

```python
df['Gender'] = df['Gender'].map({'Female': 0, 'Male': 1})
```

### 2. One-Hot Encoding (pd.get_dummies)
Turns categories into separate columns with 0/1 values.

```python
df = pd.concat([df, pd.get_dummies(df['City'], drop_first=True)], axis=1)
df.drop('City', axis=1, inplace=True)
```

**Tip:** Use label encoding for order/rank (e.g. age groups), one-hot for names or unordered groups.

---

## Extracting Date/Time Features

Dates often hide useful info!
- Extract day, month, and year to understand seasonal patterns.

```python
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date of Journey'])
df['Day'] = df['Date'].dt.day
df['Month'] = df['Date'].dt.month
df['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year
```

Then, you can drop the original date column.

---

## Visualizing Data for Insights

Plots are your best friend in EDA!  
**Examples:**
- **Pie Chart:** Show distribution of orders across countries.
- **Bar Plot:** See ratings frequency.

```python
# Pie chart for country distribution
country_counts = final_df['Country'].value_counts()
plt.pie(country_counts.values[:3],
        labels=country_counts.index[:3],
        autopct="%.2f%%")
plt.title("Top 3 Countries Using Zomato")
plt.show()
```

---

## Feature Engineering in Practice

### Create new features

Sometimes, you need to create new columns to capture hidden information.

- **Total stops for flights:** Convert "non-stop", "2 stops" to numbers.
```python
mapping = {'non-stop':0, '1 stop':1, '2 stops':2, '3 stops':3}
df['Total_Stops'] = df['Total_Stops'].map(mapping)
```
- **Duration:** Convert "2h 50m" to minutes.
- **Bucketize ages:** Turn "0-17" into categorical ranks.

### Scaling Features

Rescale numeric columns so everything is on similar scales (important for many models):

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
df['price_scaled'] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['Price']])
```

---

## Observing Relationships

- Use `.groupby()` and `.agg()` to explore patterns between multiple features.
- Example: Find which country gives the most zero ratings.

```python
df_zero_ratings = df[df['Aggregate_rating'] == 0].groupby('Country').size()
```

---

## Conclusion

**Key Takeaways:**
- EDA is like detective work â€“ learn what you have before you predict.
- Feature engineering lets you shape your data so your models can understand and learn.
- Always clean and encode your data before modeling.
- Visualization reveals patterns you might miss in tables.

By following these steps, you can confidently approach new datasets and extract meaningful insights!

## FAQ

**Q1: Whatâ€™s the difference between EDA and Feature Engineering?**  
EDA is for understanding and inspecting your data. Feature engineering is about transforming and creating new variables for machine learning.

**Q2: Why do we need to encode categorical variables?**  
Most ML models only work with numbers; encoding transforms text labels into numbers or binary columns.

**Q3: When should I fill missing values vs. drop them?**  
If you have many missing values in a column, you might need to drop it. If only a few are missing, filling them (imputation) maintains data quality.
