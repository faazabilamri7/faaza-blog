How I Mastered MLOps for Free in 2025: Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners

---

## Introduction  
Are you trying to break into MLOps but feel overwhelmed by the amount of resources and technical jargon out there? You’re not alone! In 2025, mastering MLOps can unlock high-demand jobs—but where do you start if you don’t want to spend thousand of dollars on courses?  
Don’t worry. In this blog, I’ll walk you through the exact free resources and steps I followed to become confident in MLOps, inspired by Abishek’s practical YouTube guide (watch it [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcWYWZEZCFM)). Whether you have experience in DevOps, Machine Learning, or are starting fresh, you’ll find beginner-friendly explanations, useful links, and a clear roadmap below.

---

## 1. **Begin with DevOps Fundamentals**  
MLOps is basically DevOps for machine learning projects. Imagine DevOps as the blueprint for building and maintaining houses (software), and MLOps as the extension for smart homes (machine learning models).

**Start with these DevOps basics:**
- **Linux:** The backbone of most servers.
- **Git:** Tracks changes in your code—like saving your work as you go.
- **Docker & Kubernetes:** Tools to pack and run your applications anywhere.
- **CI/CD:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment—think of it as automated quality checks.
- **Terraform & AWS:** Tools for managing cloud resources.
- **Python:** The most popular programming language for ML.

**Free Resource:**  
Abishek’s [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@abhishek.subscriber) has zero-to-hero playlists on all these topics—just head to the Courses section!

## 2. **Understand Machine Learning (ML) Fundamentals**  
Before jumping into MLOps, it helps to know the ML project life cycle. Imagine building a robot:  
- You gather parts (**data gathering**),
- Clean them (**data cleaning**),
- Assemble, test, and improve (**model development, tracking, monitoring, retraining**).

Your job in MLOps is to automate and simplify these steps so projects run smoothly.

**Key Stages to Learn:**
- Data Management
- Experiment Tracking
- Model Development & Deployment
- Model Monitoring & Retraining
- Project Management

**Free Resources:**  
- [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/) (no login needed—covers all basics)
- [Chris Nak’s ML YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD3lD-B5IrE1dTHkqYiaaA7y3N50NQ8TY) (6-hour practical course)

---

## 3. **Master Data Version Control (DVC)**  
Version control isn’t just for code. With ML, your datasets are often huge, so you need special tools for managing versions.

**Example Analogy:**  
Think of writing a book—every new draft is saved. With data, each new version (after processing or cleaning) gets tracked so you can return to any previous state.

**Recommended Tool:**  
- **[DVC (Data Version Control)](https://dvc.org/doc/)** – Documentation is friendly and guides you step-by-step.

---

## 4. **Track Experiments & Register Models**  
Imagine baking cookies with different recipes—you’ll want to record which tweaks made the best taste. In ML, you do this using experiment tracking tools and store the final “recipes” (models) in a registry.

**Key Tools:**
- **[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/)** – For managing experiments and hyperparameters.
- **Learn for Free:**  
  - [MLOps Zoomcamp Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvzDbLUZkbudP-MFQZwNmU4S) (focus on MLflow sections)

---

## 5. **CI/CD/CT: Automate and Continuously Train Models**  
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) ensure your code and models are always up-to-date. MLOps adds a twist—**Continuous Training (CT):**  
As new data arrives, models can get stale. Retraining keeps them performing well, like tuning up a car regularly.

**Tools & Tutorials:**
- **GitHub Actions:** Good for smaller projects.  
  - [MLOps beginner project demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcWYWZEZCFM) (from Abishek’s playlist)  
- **[Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/):** For bigger, more complex automations  
  - [Abishek’s 60-min Kubeflow Pipeline tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvxrEAe52mDjkGMwL_43ssLB)

---

## 6. **Serving Models: FastAPI & KServe**  
Once your model is ready, you have to make it available so clients or users can use it. This is called “serving” the model.

**Simple Analogy:**  
It’s like baking cookies in your kitchen and opening a shop so customers can buy them.

**Top Tools:**
- **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/):** Create web servers for models.
  - [Sartuk’s FastAPI Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvwWISVQJKdiNkd7xNKp3iHw) (beginner-friendly, 4 hours)
- **[KServe](https://kserve.github.io/website/):** For scalable, production-ready serving (part of Kubeflow, documentation is highly useful)

---

## 7. **Monitor Models for Performance**  
Just like a doctor checks your health regularly, you should monitor your models to ensure they’re working well and sending alerts if something goes wrong.

**Tools You’ll Like:**
- **Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack:** For general observability.
  - Free zero-to-hero [Observability playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvxvQJ5DrH1e-SoFlMMx6GTL)
- **[Evidently AI](https://evidentlyai.com/):** Open-source, user-friendly for ML monitoring.

---

## 8. **Feature Stores: Feast**  
A feature store helps you organize and reuse your data’s “ingredients” for both training and serving models.

**Analogy:**  
It’s like a well-stocked pantry, so you don’t have to hunt for sugar every time you bake.

**Resource:**  
- **[Feast GitHub Repository](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast):** Try Python and Java examples.
