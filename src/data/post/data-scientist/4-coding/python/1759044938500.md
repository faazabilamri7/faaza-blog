**1. What Are Regular Expressions?**

Regular expressions are like magic search patterns for text. Instead of just looking for exact words, you can define rules to match things like:
- Any three-digit number
- Words that start with a capital letter
- Email addresses (even if they’re hidden in messy strings!)

**Analogy:**  
Think of regex as a super-powered fishing net. Instead of catching only one specific fish (word), you can adjust your net to catch all kinds of patterns—big or small, simple or complex.

---

**2. Starting With Python’s `re` Module**

Python uses the `re` module to handle regex. The most common function is `re.search()`, which looks for a pattern inside a string. Here’s the simplest way to use it:

```python
import re
match = re.search(r'word:\w\w\w', 'an example word:cat!!')
if match:
    print('found', match.group())  # Output: found word:cat
else:
    print('did not find')
```
- `r'...'` means "raw string"—this keeps special characters like backslashes working correctly.
- If the pattern is found, `match.group()` returns what was matched.

**Practical Tip:**  
Always use the `r` before your patterns!

---

**3. Building Patterns: The Basics**

Regex patterns are made of characters and special symbols:
- Ordinary characters (`a`, `X`, `9`) match themselves.
- Special symbols:
    - `.` (dot): Matches any character except a newline.
    - `\w`: Matches any single letter, digit, or underscore (think of it as a "word" character).
    - `\d`: Matches a digit (0–9).
    - `\s`: Matches any whitespace (space, tab, newline).
    - `^` and `$`: Match the start and end of a string.
    - `\`: Escapes special characters (e.g., `\.` matches a literal dot).

**Example:**
```python
re.search(r'\d\d\d', 'p123g')  # Finds '123'
re.search(r'\w\w\w', '@@abcd!!')  # Finds 'abc'
```

---

**4. Pattern Power: Repetition and Greediness**

Want to match something several times in a row? Use:
- `+` : One or more times
- `*` : Zero or more times
- `?` : Zero or one time

**Example:**
```python
re.search(r'i+', 'piiig')  # Finds 'iii'
re.search(r'\d\s*\d\s*\d', 'xx1 2   3xx')  # Finds '1 2   3', allowing spaces
```
**Greedy vs Non-Greedy:**  
By default, regex takes as much as it can ("greedy"). To tell it to be less greedy, add a `?` after a repeater:

```python
re.search(r'<.*?>', '<b>foo</b> and <i>bar</i>')
# Finds '<b>' instead of '<b>foo</b> and <i>'
```

---

**5. Matching Sets: Square Brackets**

Square brackets `[ ]` tell regex to match any one character from a set.

- `[abc]` matches either `a`, `b`, or `c`
- `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter
- `[0-9]` matches any digit
- `[^ab]` matches anything EXCEPT `a` or `b`

**Email Example:**  
Say you want to find emails that also have dashes and dots in them:

```python
re.search(r'[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+', 'purple alice-b@google.com monkey dishwasher')
# Finds 'alice-b@google.com'
```

---

**6. Grouping and Extracting Data**

Parentheses `()` let you extract parts of your match by turning them into "groups".

**Example:**
```python
match = re.search(r'([\w.-]+)@([\w.-]+)', 'alice-b@google.com')
if match:
    print(match.group(1))  # 'alice-b'
    print(match.group(2))  # 'google.com'
```
This lets you grab usernames and hosts from emails separately!

---

**7. Finding Multiple Matches: `findall()`**

If there are lots of matches, `findall()` returns them all as a list.

**Example:**
```python
emails = re.findall(r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+', 'alice@google.com, bob@abc.com')
# Output: ['alice@google.com', 'bob@abc.com']
```

With groups, it gives you a list of tuples:
```python
tuples = re.findall(r'([\w.-]+)@([\w.-]+)', 'alice@google.com, bob@abc.com')
# Output: [('alice', 'google.com'), ('bob', 'abc.com')]
```

---

**8. Substitution: Replace with `re.sub()`**

Want to change all email hosts to, say, “yo-yo-dyne.com”?

**Example:**
```python
re.sub(r'([\w\.-]+)@([\w\.-]+)', r'\1@yo-yo-dyne.com', 'alice@google.com, bob@abc.com')
# Output: 'alice@yo-yo-dyne.com, bob@yo-yo-dyne.com'
```

---

**9. Useful Extras & Options**

- **re.IGNORECASE**: Ignore capitalization.
- **re.DOTALL**: Make `.` match newlines too.
- **re.MULTILINE**: Make `^` and `$` match the start/end of each line.

---

**Conclusion:**

Regular expressions are an amazingly powerful way to find, match, and change patterns in text. In Python, the `re` module gives you all the tools you need—even if you’re just starting out. Try writing one pattern at a time, testing with simple print statements, and gradually building up your patterns. Before you know it, you’ll be a regex whiz!

**FAQ**

**Q1: Are regular expressions hard to learn?**  
Regular expressions can look confusing at first, but with a bit of practice and breaking them down into sections, they get easier. Start simple and build from there!

**Q2: Do I always need to use `re.search()` or are there other useful functions?**  
Besides `re.search()`, you'll often use `re.findall()` to get all matches, `re.sub()` for replacing, and `re.match()` to check if a pattern starts a string.

**Q3: Why does my pattern sometimes match too much or too little?**  
Often, this is due to “greediness” or not specifying exactly what you want to match. Try adjusting your pattern with non-greedy modifiers or by breaking it into smaller chunks.
