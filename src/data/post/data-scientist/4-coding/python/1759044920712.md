### **What Is a Python Dictionary?**

Think of a Python dictionary as a real-life dictionary: you look up a word (the key) and get its definition (the value). In Python, a dictionary stores items as pairs—like a name and a phone number.

#### **How It Works:**
- A dictionary is written with curly braces `{}`:  
  `my_dict = {'apple': 10, 'banana': 5}`
- Each item is a “key: value” pair.
- You can quickly find a value using its key, change values, add new items, or remove items.

#### **Example:**

```python
scores = {}
scores['Alice'] = 90
scores['Bob'] = 85
scores['Charlie'] = 78
print(scores)
# Output: {'Alice': 90, 'Bob': 85, 'Charlie': 78}
```

It’s like having a personal phonebook. You know the name (key), you get the score (value).

### **Working With Dictionaries: Basic Operations**

#### **Looking Up and Adding Values**

- Find a value:
  ```python
  print(scores['Alice'])  # 90
  ```
- Add or update:
  ```python
  scores['Alice'] = 95  # changes Alice's score
  ```
- Check if a key exists:
  ```python
  'Dan' in scores  # False
  # This avoids errors if the key is missing
  ```

#### **Avoiding Errors: The `.get()` Method**

Looking up a key that doesn’t exist causes an error. Use `get()` to avoid this:
```python
print(scores.get('Dan'))  # None (safe)
```
You can even set a default value:
```python
print(scores.get('Dan', 'Not found'))  # Not found
```

#### **Looping Through a Dictionary**

- Loop over keys:
  ```python
  for name in scores:
      print(name)
  ```
- Loop over values:
  ```python
  for value in scores.values():
      print(value)
  ```
- Loop over key-value pairs:
  ```python
  for name, score in scores.items():
      print(f'{name} got {score}')
  ```

### **Using Dictionaries for Real Tasks**

Imagine you’re reading a list of fruit sales and want to count how many times each fruit appears. Dictionaries make this super easy!

#### **Example:**

```python
sales = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple']
counts = {}
for fruit in sales:
    counts[fruit] = counts.get(fruit, 0) + 1
print(counts)
# Output: {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1}
```

---

### **Deleting From Dictionaries and Lists**

- Remove an item from a dictionary:
  ```python
  del scores['Bob']
  print(scores)  # {'Alice': 95, 'Charlie': 78}
  ```
- Remove items from a list:
  ```python
  fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
  del fruits[1]
  print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'cherry']
  ```

### **Reading and Writing Files in Python**

You can save data to a file (like saving your work in a notebook), and read it back later.

#### **Basic Steps:**
1. **Open the file:**  
   `f = open('data.txt', 'r')`  (for reading)  
   `f = open('data.txt', 'w')`  (for writing)
2. **Read or write:**  
   For reading:  
   ```python
   for line in f:
       print(line)
   ```
   For writing:  
   ```python
   f.write("Hello, World!\n")
   ```
3. **Finish:**  
   `f.close()`

#### **Handy Tip:**  
Reading one line at a time means you don't need lots of computer memory—even for huge files!

#### **Working With Unicode Files:**

If your text has special characters (like é or €), use the encoding option:
```python
with open('file.txt', 'rt', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
```
- This keeps things safe and readable!

### **Putting It All Together: A Simple Example**

Suppose you want to read a file and count how many times each word appears, using a dictionary to tally them. You build your program step by step, testing at each stage—just like marking progress on a big school project!

### **Conclusion**

Python's dictionaries are your best friend for organizing data by “name and value,” while files let you save and read data whenever you need. Use dictionaries to sort, count, and organize information. Use files to store your results or read new data. By learning these basics, you’re opening the door to all kinds of powerful programs!

### **FAQ**

**Q1: Can a dictionary have any type of key or value?**  
A: Keys must be “immutable”—they can't change. Strings and numbers work well. Values can be any type.

**Q2: Is it OK to read giant files with Python?**  
A: Yes! Reading line by line is memory-friendly and works great even for huge files.

**Q3: What’s the fastest way to see if something is in my dictionary?**  
A: Use `'key' in dict` or `dict.get('key')` for speedy checks.
