## Introduction

You've learned how to build Docker images and run containers—but how do you actually use Docker in real-world development teams? How do you keep your containers secure? And most importantly, how do you deploy your containerized applications to production?

This final article in our Docker series answers these critical questions. We'll explore container security best practices, modern development workflows that leverage Docker, the concept of ephemeral environments for testing, and various deployment options from simple to sophisticated.

By the end of this guide, you'll understand the complete lifecycle of containerized applications—from your local development environment all the way to production servers serving real users.

## Container Security: Protecting Your Applications

Security is often an afterthought, but with containers, it should be built into your process from day one. Let's explore the key security considerations.

### The Security Landscape: What Are We Protecting Against?

**Common threats:**

1. **Vulnerable dependencies:** Using libraries or base images with known security flaws
2. **Privilege escalation:** Attackers gaining root access inside containers
3. **Container escape:** Breaking out of container isolation to access the host
4. **Data exposure:** Sensitive information leaked through logs or images
5. **Supply chain attacks:** Malicious code in base images or dependencies

**The good news:** Docker provides tools and best practices to mitigate all of these!

### Security Best Practice #1: Don't Run as Root

**The problem:** By default, containers run as the root user (user ID 0). If an attacker compromises your container, they have root privileges.

**Bad Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
# ⚠️ Runs as root!
```

**Good Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

# Create a non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 appgroup && \
    adduser -D -u 1001 -G appgroup appuser

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies as root (needed for global installs)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy application code
COPY --chown=appuser:appgroup . .

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
# ✅ Runs as appuser, not root!
```

**Why this matters:** If someone exploits your app, they're limited to `appuser` permissions, not root.

**Verify who's running:**

```bash
docker exec my-container whoami
# Should output: appuser (not root)
```

### Security Best Practice #2: Use Trusted Base Images

**The risk:** Malicious or vulnerable base images can compromise your entire application.

**How to stay safe:**

**1. Use official images:**

```dockerfile
# ✅ Official image (verified by Docker)
FROM node:18-alpine

# ❌ Random image from unknown publisher
FROM randomuser/node-maybe-safe:latest
```

**2. Use specific version tags:**

```dockerfile
# ✅ Specific version
FROM node:18.17.1-alpine3.18

# ❌ Vague or missing tag
FROM node:latest
FROM node
```

**3. Scan images for vulnerabilities:**

Docker Desktop includes vulnerability scanning:

```bash
docker scan my-app:latest
```

**Example output:**

```
Testing my-app:latest...

✗ Low severity vulnerability found in curl
  Description: Buffer Overflow
  Info: https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-ALPINE318-CURL-12345
  Introduced through: curl@8.0.1-r0
  Fixed in: 8.0.2-r0
```

**How to fix:** Update your base image or install a newer package version.

**4. Use Docker Content Trust:**

Enable signed image verification:

```bash
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
docker pull node:18-alpine
```

Now Docker only pulls images with verified signatures.

### Security Best Practice #3: Minimize Image Contents

**Principle:** The less stuff in your image, the smaller the attack surface.

**Strategies:**

**1. Use minimal base images:**

```dockerfile
# Good: 170MB
FROM node:18-alpine

# Better: 5MB + Node binary
FROM alpine:3.18
RUN apk add --no-cache nodejs

# Even better for compiled languages: Distroless
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs18
```

**Distroless images:** Contain only your application and runtime dependencies—no shell, no package manager, nothing extra.

**2. Multi-stage builds to exclude build tools:**

```dockerfile
# Build stage (contains compilers, dev tools)
FROM node:18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage (only runtime)
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
USER node
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

**Result:** Final image doesn't include TypeScript compiler, dev dependencies, or source code.

### Security Best Practice #4: Handle Secrets Properly

**The problem:** Never hardcode secrets in Dockerfiles or images!

**❌ BAD - Hardcoded secret:**

```dockerfile
ENV DATABASE_PASSWORD=super-secret-123
ENV API_KEY=abc123xyz789
```

**Problem:** Anyone with access to the image can extract these!

```bash
docker history my-app  # Shows all ENV values!
docker inspect my-app  # Also reveals ENV values!
```

**✅ GOOD - Pass secrets at runtime:**

**Option 1: Environment variables (for non-production):**

```bash
docker run -e DATABASE_PASSWORD=secret123 my-app
```

**Option 2: Docker Secrets (for production with Docker Swarm):**

```bash
echo "my-secret-password" | docker secret create db_password -
docker service create \
  --name my-app \
  --secret db_password \
  my-app:latest
```

Access in your app:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const password = fs.readFileSync('/run/secrets/db_password', 'utf8');
```

**Option 3: External secret managers:**

- AWS Secrets Manager
- HashiCorp Vault
- Azure Key Vault
- Google Secret Manager

**Best practice:** Fetch secrets from these at container startup.

### Security Best Practice #5: Use Read-Only File Systems

**Concept:** Make the container's file system read-only to prevent attackers from modifying files.

```bash
docker run --read-only \
  --tmpfs /tmp \
  my-app
```

**Explanation:**

- `--read-only`: Main file system is immutable
- `--tmpfs /tmp`: Allow temporary writes to `/tmp` (in memory)

**Why this helps:** Even if exploited, attackers can't install malware or modify application code.

### Security Best Practice #6: Limit Container Capabilities

Linux capabilities are fine-grained permissions. By default, Docker gives containers more capabilities than needed.

**Drop all capabilities, add back only what's needed:**

```bash
docker run \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE \
  my-app
```

**Common capabilities:**

- `NET_BIND_SERVICE`: Bind to ports < 1024
- `CHOWN`: Change file ownership
- `SETUID/SETGID`: Change user/group IDs

**Principle of least privilege:** Only grant what's absolutely necessary.

### Security Scanning Tools

**1. Trivy (free, open-source):**

```bash
trivy image my-app:latest
```

Scans for:

- OS package vulnerabilities
- Application dependency vulnerabilities
- Misconfigurations

**2. Snyk:**

```bash
snyk container test my-app:latest
```

**3. Docker Scout (built into Docker Desktop):**

```bash
docker scout cves my-app:latest
```

**Integrate into CI/CD:** Fail builds if critical vulnerabilities are found!

## Development Workflow: Docker in Your Daily Coding

Let's explore how Docker transforms your daily development experience.

### The Traditional Workflow (Before Docker)

**Day 1 at a new company:**

1. Get a laptop
2. Read a 20-page setup document
3. Install Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, etc.
4. Configure environment variables
5. Run database migrations
6. Cross your fingers and hope it works
7. Debug for hours when it doesn't

**Time to productivity:** 1-2 days (if you're lucky)

### The Docker Workflow

**Day 1 at a company using Docker:**

1. Get a laptop
2. Install Docker
3. Clone the repository
4. Run `docker-compose up`
5. Start coding!

**Time to productivity:** 30 minutes

### Docker Compose: The Development Superpower

Docker Compose lets you define your entire development environment in one file.

**Example: Full-stack application**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  # PostgreSQL Database
  database:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp_dev
      POSTGRES_USER: devuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: devpass
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - app-network

  # Redis Cache
  cache:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    ports:
      - '6379:6379'
    networks:
      - app-network

  # Backend API
  api:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - '4000:4000'
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://devuser:devpass@database:5432/myapp_dev
      REDIS_URL: redis://cache:6379
      NODE_ENV: development
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    depends_on:
      - database
      - cache
    networks:
      - app-network
    command: npm run dev

  # Frontend React App
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    environment:
      REACT_APP_API_URL: http://localhost:4000
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    depends_on:
      - api
    networks:
      - app-network
    command: npm start

networks:
  app-network:

volumes:
  postgres-data:
```

**Commands:**

```bash
# Start everything
docker-compose up

# Start in background
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f api

# Stop everything
docker-compose down

# Rebuild images
docker-compose build

# Run a command in a service
docker-compose exec api npm test
```

### Hot Reloading: The Developer Experience Wins

Notice the volume mounts in the compose file:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./backend:/app
  - /app/node_modules
```

**What this does:**

1. Mounts your local `./backend` directory to `/app` in the container
2. Excludes `node_modules` (uses the container's version)

**Result:**

- Edit code on your laptop in VS Code
- Changes are immediately reflected in the container
- Your development server (like `nodemon` or `webpack-dev-server`) detects changes
- Application auto-reloads

**You get the benefits of:**

- ✅ Consistent environment (everyone uses the same Docker setup)
- ✅ Fast feedback loop (code changes reflect immediately)
- ✅ Isolated dependencies (container's node_modules, not your host's)

### Development Dockerfile vs Production Dockerfile

**Dockerfile.dev (for development):**

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Install ALL dependencies (including devDependencies)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Don't copy source code (it's mounted as a volume)

# Run development server with hot reloading
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

**Dockerfile (for production):**

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules

USER node
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

**Key differences:**

- Dev: Includes dev dependencies, no build step, mounts source code
- Prod: Only production dependencies, optimized build, copies built artifacts

### Debugging in Containers

**Attach a debugger to a Node.js app:**

**docker-compose.yml:**

```yaml
api:
  build: ./backend
  ports:
    - '4000:4000'
    - '9229:9229' # Debugger port
  command: node --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229 server.js
```

**VS Code launch.json:**

```json
{
  "type": "node",
  "request": "attach",
  "name": "Docker: Attach to Node",
  "remoteRoot": "/app",
  "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/backend",
  "port": 9229
}
```

Now you can set breakpoints in VS Code and debug code running in Docker!

## Ephemeral Environments: The Future of Testing

### What Are Ephemeral Environments?

**Traditional approach:**

- Dev environment (shared by all developers)
- Staging environment (for pre-production testing)
- Production environment

**Problem:**

- Limited environments = bottlenecks
- Conflicts when multiple features are tested on the same staging
- "It worked on staging!" (but staging is different now)

**Ephemeral environments:**

- Temporary, isolated environments
- Created automatically for each pull request
- Destroyed when no longer needed
- Identical to production (just smaller scale)

**Benefits:**

1. **Parallel testing:** Every feature gets its own environment
2. **True isolation:** Changes don't affect other tests
3. **Better QA:** Test exactly what will be deployed
4. **Faster feedback:** No waiting for shared staging to be free

### How Docker Enables Ephemeral Environments

**The magic:** Because containers are fast to start and stop, you can spin up entire environments on-demand.

**Flow:**

1. Developer opens a pull request
2. CI/CD system detects it
3. Builds Docker images from the PR code
4. Deploys containers to a temporary environment
5. Generates a unique URL: `pr-123.staging.company.com`
6. QA team tests on that URL
7. When PR is merged, environment is destroyed

**Example with Shipyard (mentioned in the course):**

Shipyard automatically creates these ephemeral environments for every pull request.

**Add to your repo:**

`.shipyard.yml`

```yaml
app:
  services:
    - name: api
      build:
        context: ./backend
      env:
        DATABASE_URL: postgres://db:5432/myapp
    - name: frontend
      build:
        context: ./frontend
      env:
        API_URL: https://{{shipyard.host}}/api
    - name: db
      image: postgres:15-alpine
```

**What happens:**

- Push code → Shipyard builds images
- Creates isolated environment
- Provides URL for testing
- Destroys environment when PR is closed

**Result:** Faster development cycles and higher quality releases!

## Deployment: Getting Containers to Production

Now for the big question: How do you deploy your containerized applications?

### Deployment Option 1: Single Server with Docker Compose

**Best for:**

- Small applications
- MVPs and side projects
- Low traffic sites

**Setup:**

1. **Get a VPS (Virtual Private Server):**
   - DigitalOcean Droplet
   - AWS EC2
   - Linode
   - Hetzner

2. **Install Docker and Docker Compose:**

```bash
# On Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
```

3. **Upload your code and docker-compose.yml:**

```bash
scp -r ./* user@your-server:/app
```

4. **Run on the server:**

```bash
ssh user@your-server
cd /app
docker-compose up -d
```

**Pros:**

- ✅ Simple
- ✅ Low cost ($5-10/month)
- ✅ Full control

**Cons:**

- ❌ No auto-scaling
- ❌ No automatic failover
- ❌ Manual updates

### Deployment Option 2: Docker Swarm

**What is Docker Swarm?**
A container orchestrator built into Docker. It manages containers across multiple servers.

**Best for:**

- Medium-sized applications
- Need for high availability
- Teams comfortable with Docker

**Key concepts:**

**1. Nodes:** Servers in your swarm

- **Manager nodes:** Control the swarm
- **Worker nodes:** Run containers

**2. Services:** Define how containers should run

```bash
docker service create \
  --name web \
  --replicas 3 \
  --publish 80:80 \
  my-web-app:latest
```

**3. Stacks:** Multi-service applications (like Compose for production)

**docker-stack.yml:**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    image: my-app:1.2.3
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
      update_config:
        parallelism: 1
        delay: 10s
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    networks:
      - app-network

  database:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == manager
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - app-network

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: overlay

volumes:
  db-data:
```

**Deploy:**

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml myapp
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Load balancing (automatic)
- ✅ Rolling updates (zero downtime)
- ✅ Self-healing (restarts failed containers)
- ✅ Secrets management
- ✅ Scales across multiple servers

**Scaling:**

```bash
docker service scale myapp_web=10  # Scale to 10 replicas
```

**Pros:**

- ✅ Built into Docker (no new tools to learn)
- ✅ Simpler than Kubernetes
- ✅ Good for small to medium deployments

**Cons:**

- ❌ Less ecosystem than Kubernetes
- ❌ Fewer managed services support it

### Deployment Option 3: Kubernetes

**What is Kubernetes?**
The industry-standard container orchestrator. Think of it as Docker Swarm's more powerful (and complex) cousin.

**Best for:**

- Large applications
- Microservices architectures
- Need for advanced features
- Multi-cloud deployments

**Key concepts:**

**1. Pods:** Smallest deployable unit (usually one container)

**2. Deployments:** Define desired state

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: web
          image: my-app:1.2.3
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

**3. Services:** Networking and load balancing

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: web
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

**Deploy:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

**Managed Kubernetes options:**

- **AWS:** Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
- **Google Cloud:** Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- **Azure:** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **DigitalOcean:** DigitalOcean Kubernetes

**Pros:**

- ✅ Industry standard
- ✅ Massive ecosystem
- ✅ Advanced features (auto-scaling, self-healing, etc.)
- ✅ Runs anywhere

**Cons:**

- ❌ Steep learning curve
- ❌ Complex to manage yourself
- ❌ Expensive (managed services)

### Deployment Option 4: Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

**What are PaaS platforms?**
Services that abstract away infrastructure—you just push your container, they handle the rest.

**Popular options:**

**1. Railway:**

- Connect GitHub repo
- Detects Dockerfile
- Auto-deploys on push
- Pricing: Pay per usage

**2. Render:**

- Similar to Railway
- Free tier available
- Simple deployment

**3. Fly.io:**

- Deploy containers globally
- Edge computing
- Good for low-latency apps

**4. AWS Fargate:**

- Run containers without managing servers
- Integrates with AWS ecosystem
- Pay only for what you use

**5. Google Cloud Run:**

- Serverless container platform
- Auto-scales to zero
- Pay per request

**Example: Deploy to Railway**

1. **Create `railway.json`:**

```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "node server.js",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE"
  }
}
```

2. **Push to GitHub**

3. **Connect Railway to your repo**

4. **Railway automatically:**
   - Builds your Dockerfile
   - Deploys the container
   - Provides a public URL
   - Rebuilds on every push

**Pros:**

- ✅ Extremely simple
- ✅ Fast to get started
- ✅ Minimal DevOps knowledge needed
- ✅ Free tiers available

**Cons:**

- ❌ Less control
- ❌ Can get expensive at scale
- ❌ Platform lock-in

## Choosing Your Deployment Strategy

**Decision tree:**

```
Start here: How much traffic do you expect?

├─ Low traffic (<1000 users/day)
│  └─ Single server with Docker Compose
│     Cost: $5-20/month
│     Complexity: ⭐
│
├─ Medium traffic (1K-100K users/day)
│  ├─ Want simple? → PaaS (Railway, Render)
│  │  Cost: $20-100/month
│  │  Complexity: ⭐
│  │
│  └─ Want control? → Docker Swarm
│     Cost: $50-200/month
│     Complexity: ⭐⭐⭐
│
└─ High traffic (>100K users/day)
   └─ Kubernetes (managed service)
      Cost: $200-2000+/month
      Complexity: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```

**My recommendation for learning:**

1. Start with Docker Compose on a single server
2. Try a PaaS for simplicity
3. Learn Docker Swarm when you need orchestration
4. Tackle Kubernetes when you need its specific features

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### Automating Your Docker Workflow

**Goal:** Every code push automatically builds, tests, and deploys your containers.

**Example: GitHub Actions**

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t my-app:${{ github.sha }} .

      - name: Run tests
        run: docker run my-app:${{ github.sha }} npm test

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Push image
        run: |
          docker tag my-app:${{ github.sha }} myuser/my-app:latest
          docker push myuser/my-app:${{ github.sha }}
          docker push myuser/my-app:latest

      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          ssh ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USER }}@${{ secrets.DEPLOY_HOST }} \

             docker-compose up -d"
```

**What this does:**

1. Triggers on every push to `main`
2. Builds your Docker image
3. Runs tests inside a container
4. Pushes image to Docker Hub
5. SSHs to your server and deploys

**Result:** Fully automated deployments!

## Monitoring and Logging

Once deployed, you need to know what's happening.

### Logging

**View logs:**

```bash
# Docker Compose
docker-compose logs -f

# Docker Swarm
docker service logs -f myapp_web

# Kubernetes
kubectl logs -f deployment/web-app
```

**Centralized logging solutions:**

- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Loki + Grafana**
- **CloudWatch Logs** (AWS)
- **Datadog**

**Example: Ship logs to Loki**

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: my-app
    logging:
      driver: loki
      options:
        loki-url: 'http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push'
```

### Monitoring

**What to monitor:**

- Container health
- CPU/memory usage
- Request rates
- Error rates
- Response times

**Tools:**

- **Prometheus + Grafana** (open source, popular)
- **Datadog** (paid, comprehensive)
- **New Relic** (paid, easy setup)

**Example: Prometheus metrics**

```yaml
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    ports:
      - '9090:9090'
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes?**

A: **Start with Docker Swarm if:**

- Your team is small (< 10 people)
- You're already comfortable with Docker
- You need orchestration but not Kubernetes' complexity

**Use Kubernetes if:**

- You're building a large-scale application
- You need advanced features (auto-scaling, complex networking)
- You want to leverage the massive Kubernetes ecosystem
- You're okay with the learning curve

Many successful companies run on Swarm. Don't feel pressured to use Kubernetes unless you truly need it.

**Q: How do I handle database migrations in containers?**

A: Common approaches:

**Option 1: Init container (Kubernetes)**

- Run migration container before app containers start
- Ensures DB is up-to-date before traffic hits

**Option 2: Startup script**

```dockerfile
COPY entrypoint.sh /
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
npm run migrate  # Run migrations
npm start        # Start app
```

**Option 3: Separate job**

- Run migrations as a separate one-time job
- Then deploy application containers

**Q: What about serverless vs containers?**

A: **Use serverless (Lambda, Cloud Functions) when:**

- Unpredictable, bursty traffic
- Want to pay only for actual requests
- Simple, stateless functions

**Use containers when:**

- Consistent traffic patterns
- Need full control over environment
- Complex applications with state
- Cost-effective at scale

**You can also combine them!** Use serverless for API Gateway, containers for your core app.

## Your Next Steps

You've learned Docker—now it's time to practice!

**Challenges:**

1. **Beginner:** Containerize a personal project and run it locally
2. **Intermediate:** Set up a full development environment with Docker Compose (frontend, backend, database)
3. **Advanced:** Deploy a multi-container application to production with CI/CD
4. **Expert:** Implement zero-downtime deployments with Docker Swarm or Kubernetes

**Resources to continue learning:**

## Final Thoughts

Docker has transformed how we build and deploy software. What once took days of setup now takes minutes. What required teams of operations engineers can now be managed by developers.

But remember: **Docker is a tool, not a goal.** Use it to solve real problems:

- Inconsistent development environments? Docker.
- Complex deployment processes? Docker.
- Need to scale efficiently? Docker with orchestration.

Start simple, learn incrementally, and don't over-engineer. A well-dockerized application running on a single server is better than a poorly-architected mess spread across a Kubernetes cluster.
