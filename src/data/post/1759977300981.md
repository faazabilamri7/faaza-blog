**Quick promise:** By the end of this short guide you’ll understand what Flowise is, the main pieces you’ll use (Agentflow, Document Stores, Variables, Prediction API), and you’ll have a simple step-by-step plan to build a basic Q&A agent — with the official docs linked where relevant so you can jump straight to examples. ([docs.flowiseai.com][1])

## Introduction — why Flowise and why now?

If you want to build an AI assistant or a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system without writing every integration from scratch, Flowise is a visual platform that helps you *wire up* language models, document stores, and logic using a drag-and-drop builder. Think of it like building with LEGO blocks instead of soldering circuits — fast to prototype, easy to understand. This guide explains the core concepts and gives practical steps you can follow, with official Flowise references embedded so you can read deeper. ([docs.flowiseai.com][1])

## What is Flowise? (plain language)

* **Short definition:** Flowise is an open-source visual platform for building AI agents and LLM workflows — it gives you a visual editor, connectors (document stores, APIs), and tools to deploy and test flows. ([docs.flowiseai.com][1])
* **Analogy:** Imagine Flowise as a workshop where each node is a tool (embedding, retriever, prompt template, LLM) and you snap tools together to create an assistant.
* **Why it matters:** You can prototype RAG, chatbots, multi-agent flows, or embed chat widgets without wiring up every piece by hand. ([docs.flowiseai.com][1])

## Core building blocks (one idea per subsection)

### Agentflow (the “brains” workflow)

* **What it is:** Agentflow is Flowise’s system for creating agent logic and multi-agent setups. Agentflow V2 brings more architecture and node references for building multi-agent systems. Think of Agentflow as the decision maker that chooses nodes, tools, and how to chain them. ([docs.flowiseai.com][2])
* **Example:** You can have one agent that retrieves documents and another that summarizes — Agentflow wires them so they cooperate like teammates.

### Document Stores & Upsertion (where your data lives)

* **What they do:** Document Stores let you upload PDFs, text, or other files; Flowise splits and processes them and upserts (uploads + indexes) them into a vector store so your agent can retrieve relevant snippets. This is the backbone of RAG. ([docs.flowiseai.com][3])
* **Analogy:** Think of embeddings as library index cards — upsertion is filing those cards so the librarian (retriever) can quickly find related passages.

### Embeddings (how text becomes searchable)

* **Plain idea:** Embeddings turn text into numerical vectors so you can measure "closeness" and find similar documents. They let your agent find relevant content quickly. ([docs.flowiseai.com][4])

### Prediction API & Streaming (how you talk to a flow)

* **Prediction API:** After you build a flow, Flowise exposes a prediction endpoint where you send a message and get the agent’s response — useful for apps, webhooks, or testing. ([docs.flowiseai.com][5])
* **Streaming:** For responsive UIs you can enable streaming so tokens arrive progressively (a nicer UX for chat). ([docs.flowiseai.com][6])

### Variables & Workspaces (small things that scale big)

* **Variables:** Reuse values across nodes (static or read from environment at runtime) — handy for API keys, thresholds, or user IDs. ([docs.flowiseai.com][7])
* **Workspaces:** Isolate projects, teams, and resources — create separate workspaces for distinct projects or teams. ([docs.flowiseai.com][8])

## Build a simple Q&A agent — step-by-step (high level)

Use this as a checklist. Each bullet is short and actionable.

1. **Prepare your data**

   * Collect docs (PDFs, text, FAQs).
2. **Create a Document Store in Flowise**

   * Upload files and let Flowise chunk & process them (Document Stores page). ([docs.flowiseai.com][3])
3. **Upsert the data** into a vector store (this creates embeddings and stores vectors). ([docs.flowiseai.com][9])
4. **Open Agentflow (or Chatflow)** and add nodes:

   * Retriever node (use your Document Store).
   * Prompt template node (write the question + retrieved context).
   * LLM node (choose your model/provider).
   * Optionally a summarizer or filter node.
5. **Wire the nodes**: user → retriever → prompt → LLM → output.
6. **Test via Prediction API**: send a request to `/prediction/{flowId}` to see the agent’s output. For real-time UX, enable streaming. ([docs.flowiseai.com][5])
7. **Iterate**: tweak chunk sizes, prompt wording, and variable defaults to improve answers.

**Why this order?** You first need searchable content (upsert), then you build logic (Agentflow), then you expose it (Prediction API) — that sequence keeps development smooth.

## Practical tips & best practices

* **Smaller chunks often help retrieval** — experiment with 200–500 token chunks. (Start conservative.)
* **Use clear prompt templates** — show the model examples and a clear instruction (system/prompt engineering basics).
* **Store secrets in Variables** (not inline) — use runtime/static type variables for API keys. ([docs.flowiseai.com][7])
* **Use Workspaces for team isolation** (separate dev vs prod). ([docs.flowiseai.com][8])
* **Enable tracing/analytics** to monitor answers and regressions (Flowise supports tracing & integrations). ([docs.flowiseai.com][1])

---

## Common pitfalls & quick fixes

* **Retriever returns irrelevant text:** try smaller chunk sizes, change embedding model, or increase top-k retrieved items. ([docs.flowiseai.com][4])
* **Streaming not showing in your app:** confirm your client subscribes to SSE/socket stream and that streaming was enabled in Prediction settings. ([docs.flowiseai.com][6])
* **Upsert errors or timeouts:** check file sizes and Flowise file upload limits (or upsert in smaller batches). ([docs.flowiseai.com][3])

## Short FAQ (beginners)

**Q: Is Flowise free / open source?**
A: Yes — Flowise is open source and you can self-host it (repo & docs available). Use the repo for deployment instructions. ([GitHub][10])

**Q: Can I embed a chat widget on my website?**
A: Yes — Flowise provides an embed widget and related docs (copy a script tag into your page), plus community examples for proxy setups if you want more security. ([docs.flowiseai.com][11])

**Q: Where do I find API details (prediction, variables, upsert)?**
A: The API Reference covers Prediction, Variables, Upsert History and Document Store endpoints — good for integrating Flowise into your app. ([docs.flowiseai.com][5])

## Conclusion — your next 30 minutes

* **If you have 30 minutes:** gather one or two short docs (one PDF or a small FAQ), create a Document Store, upsert, and build a minimal Agentflow with retriever → prompt → LLM. Test with the Prediction API. You’ll learn a lot by doing. ([docs.flowiseai.com][3])
