**Section 1: How These Courses Were Chosen**

Before jumping into the list, here’s my selection criteria—so you can trust these picks:

- **Practical AI Engineering:** These are not just “machine learning theory” classes. They teach how to apply, deploy, and work with real AI models.
- **Complete Skill Coverage:** Courses cover the essentials—like prompt engineering, deploying models, and working with data—so you get the full picture.
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Focus on courses that start from basics, but scale up to more advanced skills.
- **Hands-On Learning:** Practical projects and labs are key, not just lectures.
- **Evaluated on Five Points:**  
  - Theory (how well concepts are explained)
  - Engineering (skills to build real apps)
  - Price (affordability)
  - Ratings (user feedback)
  - Interactivity (engagement via exercises, quizzes, etc.)

Each factor was scored from 0–2 for an easy comparison.
