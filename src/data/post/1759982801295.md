**Workspaces Made Simple: A Beginner’s Guide to Managing Teams and Resources in Flowise**

---

## Introduction

Imagine you’re organizing a big event, and you need to keep everyone’s tasks separate—catering, music, and decoration. You wouldn’t want the chef to accidentally change the playlist, right? That’s exactly the kind of clarity and control that **Workspaces** give you in Flowise.  
In this guide, we’ll break down what workspaces are, why they matter, and how you can set up and manage them easily, even if you’re new to organizational tools. By the end, you’ll be ready to confidently use workspaces to keep your teams and projects running smoothly.

## What is a Workspace?

Think of a workspace as a virtual room dedicated to a specific team or project. Each workspace holds its own resources—like chatbots, settings, and user permissions—completely separate from other rooms.  
This helps organizations:

- **Keep things organized** – Separate teams, business units, or projects
- **Control access** – Let people see only what they need to do their job
- **Increase security** – Prevent accidental changes or leaks

For Flowise users on the Cloud or Enterprise plan, a **default workspace** is created automatically when you first log in. From there, you can add more workspaces as needed.

*Resource:* See [Workspaces documentation](https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-de2aaac22e8690415280667e823c1b5c35887799%2FUntitled-2024-10-19-0050.png?alt=media) for a visual overview.

## Setting Up Your Admin Account

Before you can start building teams in Flowise, you’ll need an **admin account**, which is like being the manager who oversees everything.

- For self-hosted Enterprise setups, make sure these environment variables are set:
  ```plaintext
  JWT_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET
  JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET
  JWT_ISSUER
  JWT_AUDIENCE
  JWT_TOKEN_EXPIRY_IN_MINUTES
  JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY_IN_MINUTES
  PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_EXPIRY_IN_MINS
  PASSWORD_SALT_HASH_ROUNDS
  TOKEN_HASH_SECRET
  ```
- After installation, you’ll be prompted to complete the admin setup—similar to creating the main/root user in a database.
- Once logged in, you’ll see the **User & Workspace Management** section. Your default workspace awaits!

## Creating a Workspace

Ready to add a new "room"? It’s a simple process:

1. **Go to User & Workspace Management**
2. **Click “Add New”** – This creates a shiny new workspace.
3. As creator, you’re automatically the **Organization Admin** for your new workspace.

*[Step-by-step image](https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-1c7ee1dd3db1f43668f61375a864512d41f39614%2Fimage%20(3)%20(1).png?alt=media)*

## Creating Roles

Roles work like job titles—deciding who can do what in a workspace.

- **How to Create a Role:**
  - Go to “Roles” in the sidebar
  - Click “Add Role”
  - Set permissions (who can view, edit, invite, etc.)

You might create:
- An **Editor** role (full access)
- A **Viewer** role (can see, but not change things)

(Some areas, like User & Workspace management, are only for Account Admins for now.)

*[Role setup example](https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-ef6d8157332c9fbf823431d4495a92e01dbaa5bb%2Fimage%20(6)%20(1).png?alt=media)*

## Inviting Users

Want other people in your workspace? Invite them!

- For self-hosted Enterprise, set these up first:
  ```
  INVITE_TOKEN_EXPIRY_IN_HOURS
  SMTP_HOST
  SMTP_PORT
  SMTP_USER
  SMTP_PASSWORD
  ```
- Go to “Users” in sidebar
- Click “Invite User”
- Enter the invitee’s email, choose their workspace and role
- They’ll get an email invitation. Once they accept and sign up, they join with the role you assigned.

*[See invitation process](https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-e403f932dd38d33d943812e601891f6168b9935b%2Fimage%20(9)%20(1).png?alt=media)*

## Switching and Managing Workspaces

If you’re part of multiple teams:

- Use the top-right dropdown to switch workspaces.
- Your permission (Editor, Viewer, etc.) impacts what you can do and see—like hiding “Add New” if you’re only allowed to view.

Items and settings in one workspace are **completely separate** from others, keeping work organized and secure.

## Sharing Credentials Across Workspaces

Sometimes you need to reuse resources—like API keys or login details—in multiple rooms. Flowise allows credential sharing!

- After creating a credential, click **Share**
- Select the workspaces to share it with
- Shared credentials are visible but not editable in other workspaces

*[See credential sharing](https://823733684-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F00tYLwhz5RyR7fJEhrWy%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-3d3bcc9bd0a3c1bfe3061de0d028542987387b0d%2Fimage%20(20)%20(1).png?alt=media)*

## Removing (or Deleting) a Workspace

Only the Account Admin can delete workspaces, and you must remove all users (except the original owner) first.

- Click “Delete” once workspace is empty
- **Warning:** This action is irreversible and will remove all items inside

## Conclusion

Workspaces in Flowise work like separate rooms for your teams and projects, each with its own resources, users, and permissions. By setting up workspaces, roles, and user invites correctly, you keep your organization streamlined and secure.

**Main takeaways:**
- Workspace = Team/project room
- Roles = Job permissions
- Invites = Bringing people in with the right role
- Items and credentials stay organized and secure
